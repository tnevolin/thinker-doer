#BLURB
The sea ... vast, mysterious ... and full of wealth! And the nations of Planet  
send their trade across it without a thought. Well, the sea doesn't care about  
them, so it lets them pass. But we can give the sea a little hand in teaching the  
landlubbers a lesson in humility.

Friendship and formalize what is already manifest."

"Land: Progenitor. Sea: $NAME3. Treaty: agreed."
"All Manifold Six: possible conflict. Treaty: unwise at this time."
