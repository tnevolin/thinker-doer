a geometric effect on overall military strength. Well-trained,
well-equipped troops can stand up to many more times their lesser
brethren than linear arithmetic would seem to indicate.

"You cannot hope to stand against me, $NAME1.
Pledge Blood Truce now or face total destruction."

"$TITLE0 $NAME1. My survivalist followers are content to guard their homes
in armed peace. I suggest we sign a Treaty of Friendship
and stay out of each others' way."

"Fair enough, but I shall guard my borders carefully."
"Hardly. A faction armed to the teeth hardly seems friendly to me."

"You cannot hope to stand against me, $NAME1.
Pledge Blood Truce now or face total destruction."

"Destruction: to be avoided. Truce: agreed."
"You winning: why do you offer peace? Conclusion: you: losing! Rejection!"

#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, clearly your aims and ours are mutual: survival on
this harsh world we've come upon. With you as Treaty partner, I will be less
of a target for the others, and therefore my people will not suffer."

"Right to defend: important. Treaty: agreeable."
"Weaponry: belies soft words. Treaty: not advisable."
