#BLURB
Mankind has been blind for thousands of years-for all of its history. We 
have come to a place whose wonders are a hundred-fold more amazing than 
anything on Earth. Around us is clear evidence of the will of a higher power. 
I bring the Vision to the blind eyes of men. I bring the Word to the deaf ears 
of men. I will make them see it. I will make them hear it.
