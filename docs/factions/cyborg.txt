#BLURB
Those who join us need give up only half of their humanity--the illogical, 
ill-tempered, and disordered half, commonly thought of as 'right-brain' 
functioning. In exchange, the 'left-brain' capacities are increased to undreamed 
potential. The tendency of Biologicals to cling instead to their individual 
personalities can only be attributed to archaic evolutionary tendencies.

"Our strategic simulations predict an inevitable stalemate for this 
conflict, $NAME1. We therefore attach a high value to Blood Truce at this time."

"I need no simulation to tell me that, $NAME3. Blood Truce is the best choice."
"That's funny...our simulations predict your inevitable defeat. We see no value in a Blood Truce."

#FACTIONTREATY

#caption $CAPTION7
"You have recently demonstrated enhanced left-brain activity, $TITLE0 $NAME1. 
A Treaty of Friendship would exponentially increase our mutual capabilities."

"Your conclusions are irrefutable. A Treaty is the only rational path for our people, $NAME3."
"I prefer my right-brain impulses on this one, $NAME3. You can use what's left of yours."

"Wisdom: avoid stalemate. Progenitor: better things to do. Agreement."
"Your simulations: faulty. Your defeat: inevitable. Answer: negative."

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, your devotion to research and your vast intellect make you
a suitable partner. A Treaty of Friendship would exponentially increase

"Geometric power: preferable: arithmetic power. Treaty: excellent idea."
"Logic flaw: Progenitor: no benefit: your commerce. Answer: negative."
