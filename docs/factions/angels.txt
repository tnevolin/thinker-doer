#BLURB
What's more important, the data or the jazz? Sure, sure, 'Information should
be free' and all that--but anyone can set information free. The jazz is in how
you do it, what you do it to, and in almost getting caught without getting
caught. The data is 1's and 0's. Life is the jazz.

"Military conflict diverts vital bandwidth from the struggle for network liberation.
Pledge Blood Truce that we may restore the free flow of information."

"Information does seem more important than conflict at this point. We'll sign your Truce."
"Forget it! Your feeble coders won't save you now, $NAME3!"

#FACTIONTREATY

#caption $CAPTION7
"Not only are you a wise leader,  $TITLE0 $NAME1, but we admire your style. A
Treaty of Friendship would be suitably chic, don't you agree? "

"Agreed. Code to your heart's content, $NAME3."
"What are you rambling on about, $NAME3? I would never join my fate to one so irresponsible."

#ALIENFACTIONTRUCE

#caption $CAPTION7
"Unlike you, our military ambitions are slight, $NAME1. Can't we end this war?"

"Progenitor: willing: find other targets. Truce: agreed."
"Pressing keys: not same: pressing trigger. $NAME3: prepare for death."

#ALIENFACTIONTREATY

#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, we feel a strange kindred spirit--both of us
being outcasts and mistrusted by the others on Planet. Not only
that, but we admire your jazzy neck flaps. A Treaty of Friendship
would be suitably chic, don't you agree? "

"Not understand: jazzy. Treaty: anyway. Agreement."
"Treaty: for friends. Chic: irrelevant. Answer to silly $NAME3: no."
