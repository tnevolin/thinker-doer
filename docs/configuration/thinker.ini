; ****** Game Engine Settings ******

; Make SMACX run on the native desktop resolution by disabling DirectDraw.
; Recommended value is 0. This overrides any value in Alpha Centauri.ini.
DirectDraw=0

; Skip the opening movie at startup. Overrides any value in Alpha Centauri.ini.
DisableOpeningMovie=1

; Patch game engine idle loop to reduce the CPU usage while the game is running.
cpu_idle_fix=1

; Enable smooth pixel-by-pixel scrolling on screen edges and other GUI improvements.
; This feature and PRACX cannot be enabled at the same time.
;   Change zoom level with the mouse wheel.
;   Alternatively drag map window by holding the right mouse button.
;   ALT+R shortcut toggles a feature that updates the info window for the map tile under cursor.
smooth_scrolling=0

; Scroll only if the mouse is this close to screen edges (recommended values 20 .. 100).
scroll_area=40

; Draw a special white/yellow outline on headquarters/golden age bases on the world map.
world_map_labels=1

; First give new colonies the normal base names from the faction definition,
; then use the improved method for generating unique base names across all factions.
new_base_names=1

; Enable windowed mode in custom resolution while DirectDraw=0 is set.
; If windowed mode is disabled, native desktop resolution is used instead (default).
; This mode can also be enabled from the command line with parameter "-windowed".
windowed=0
window_width=1024
window_height=768

; When SMAC-in-SMACX mod is enabled, all expansion content is removed from the game.
; Alien Crossfire techs, units, facilities, or abilities will not be available.
; This can also be selected by a command line parameter, e.g. "terranx_mod.exe -smac"
; While it is still possible to select alien factions during the game setup,
; it is not supported and may cause glitches.
; The following files must be placed in "ac_mod" folder for smac_only to work:
; alphax.txt, helpx.txt, conceptsx.txt, tutor.txt
smac_only=0

; ****** General AI Settings ******

; Enable Thinker AI for all computer factions up to this slot number.
; 0 = disable for all, 7 = enable for all

; Manage social engineering choices for Thinker factions. Note that depending on 
; the bias value improved social_ai might sometimes pick other social models 
; than the preferred choice given in the faction definition.
social_ai=1

; Set the amount of priority AI factions have for the preferred social model.
; Allowed values: 0 (no priority) - 1000. By default the priority is moderate.

; Maximum amount of satellites of each type AI should attempt to build after the techs.
max_satellites=20

; Allow AI to spend energy reserves to hurry base production.

; Minimum allowed distance between adjacent bases. Allowed values: 2-8.
base_spacing=3

; Additional constraint to base_spacing. Discard any locations that have more than
; this amount of bases at the minimum allowed distance. Comment out to disable this check.
; base_nearby_limit=2

; Limit how many bases the AI factions should have before they stop colony pod
; production entirely. This expansion limit remains fixed for all map sizes.
; Global base limit imposed by the game engine will always be 512 bases.
expansion_limit=50

; Scale expansion_limit automatically to match the amount of bases by the human player.
expansion_autoscale=1

; Thinker AI is only allowed to start secret projects if the human player does not
; have their required techs when the difficulty level is above the specified value.

; ****** Game Rules Changes ******
; *** These apply to all factions regardless of factions_enabled setting. ***

; Set AI cost factors for nutrient/mineral production for each difficulty level respectively.
; All other difficulty level modifiers remain unaffected by this setting. Minimum value: 1.
; Example: 10 = 100% of human cost (Librarian), 7 = 70% of human cost (Transcend)
cost_factor=13,12,11,10,8,7

; When revised_tech_cost is enabled, this factor is applied on AI research costs.
; This scale is different to previous option. 100 = 100% of human cost.
tech_cost_factor=124,116,108,100,84,76

; Improved tech cost mechanic to increase late game research costs (see Details.md)
; Tech costs scale relative to the level of current research item, instead of the
; old version where costs increased according to the amount of techs a faction had.
revised_tech_cost=0

; Set the number of content base population for player/AI factions for each difficulty level.
; Any additional population after this number will be drones unless this is modified by
; psych-related effects or faction abilities. Only non-negative values are allowed.
; Commenting out both lines will make the game use the default psych calculation.
content_pop_player=6,5,4,3,2,1

; Make the combat calculation ignore reactor power and treat every unit as having
; a fission reactor. More advanced reactors still provide their usual cost discounts.
; Planet busters are unaffected by this feature.
ignore_reactor_power=0

; Modifies how territory borders are drawn on the map. In vanilla game mechanics, tiles
; that are equidistant between two different faction bases are claimed by the newest base.
; This patch makes the oldest base always claim those tiles. Coastal bases also expand
; territory into the ocean in a similar way compared to actual ocean bases.
territory_border_fix=1

; Automatically relocate lost headquarters to another suitable base.
auto_relocate_hq=1

; In vanilla game mechanics, eco damage on AI bases is notably reduced from player levels.
; This patch increases AI eco damage to the same level than what the player bases have.
; In addition, constructing Tree Farms and similar facilities always increases the clean 
; minerals limit even before the first fungal pop.
eco_damage_fix=1

; Amount of minerals a base can produce before experiencing eco damage. This limit is also 
; increased by one after each fungal pop or after building Tree Farms and similar facilities.
clean_minerals=24

; Select if the planet should randomly spawn spore launchers and other expansion-only units.
; Factions can still build some of these units if they are not disabled from alphax.txt.
