; When SMAC-in-SMACX mod is enabled, all expansion content is removed from the game.
; Alien Crossfire techs, units, facilities, or abilities will not be available.
; This can also be enabled by a command line parameter "thinker.exe -smac"

; Auto-design special units for all computer factions and disband obsolete prototypes.
; This includes improved probe teams, formers, battleships and AAA garrison units.
design_units=1

; Maximum amount of satellites of each type AI should attempt to build after the techs.
max_satellites=20

; Allow AI to spend energy reserves to hurry base production.
; 0 = disable always, 1 = hurry normal facilities and units, 2 = also hurry secret projects.
base_hurry=2

; Minimum allowed distance between adjacent bases. Allowed values: 2-8.
base_spacing=3

; Additional constraint to base_spacing. Discard any locations that have more than
; this amount of bases at the minimum allowed distance. Comment out to disable this check.
base_nearby_limit=2

; Limit how many bases each AI faction should have before they stop colony pod
; production entirely. This expansion limit remains fixed for all map sizes.
; Global base limit imposed by the game engine will always be 512 bases.
expansion_limit=50

; This option scales the base limit to match the player base count if it is larger
; than current expansion_limit. Otherwise expansion_limit value is used instead.
expansion_autoscale=1

; When current difficulty level is below this value the AI factions can't start a secret project
; until the player has its prerequisite tech, even if the AIs already have the same tech.
; Allowed values: 0-6, 0 = allow always, 3 = original default, 6 = apply limit on all levels.
limit_project_start=3

; ****** Game Rules Changes ******
; *** These apply to all factions regardless of factions_enabled setting. ***

; Set AI cost factors for nutrient/mineral production for each difficulty level respectively.
; All difficulty levels must be listed separated by commas from Citizen to Transcend level.
; Original defaults: cost_factor=13,12,11,10,8,7
cost_factor=12,11,10,9,8,7

; In vanilla game mechanics, if the player faction is ranked first, then the AIs
; will get additional growth/industry bonuses. If this simple version is enabled,
; AIs will always use the cost factors set above.
simple_cost_factor=0

; Improved tech cost mechanic to increase late game research costs (see Details.md)
; Tech costs scale relative to the level of current research target, instead of the
; old version where costs increased according to the amount of techs a faction had.
revised_tech_cost=1

; When revised_tech_cost is enabled, this factor is applied on AI research costs.
; Example: 100 = 100% of human cost, 76 = 76% of human cost.
tech_cost_factor=116,108,100,92,84,76

; When revised_tech_cost and Tech Stagnation options are enabled, multiply all
; tech costs by this percentage. Original default is 150.
tech_stagnate_rate=200

; Set the number of content base population for player/AI factions for each difficulty level.
; Any additional population after this number will be drones unless this is modified by
; psych-related effects or faction abilities. Only non-negative values are allowed.
; Original defaults: content_pop_player=6,5,4,3,2,1 and content_pop_computer=3,3,3,3,3,3
content_pop_player=6,5,4,3,2,1
content_pop_computer=3,3,3,3,3,3

; Enable modified base psych routines with minor changes on psych energy allocation
; and secret projects that provide talents have more consistent effects.
; Regardless of this choice content_pop options are still always used.
base_psych=1

; When enabled, bases that have sufficient drone control facilities available before
; the growth phase can grow without triggering possible drone riots on the same turn.
delay_drone_riots=1

; Select whether to allow nerve stapling during the game.
; 0 = disable for all, 1 = enable for AIs only, 2 = enable for all.
nerve_staple=2

; When current SE Police rating is below this value, nerve staple effects expire twice as fast.
; This significantly reduces the incentive to switch social models after stapling bases.
; The game always disallows additional nerve stapling when SE Police < 0.
nerve_staple_mod=0

; When moving non-native units into land fungus squares, always limit the movement cost
; to full speed of the unit. This avoids random waiting when trying to enter fungus tiles.
fast_fungus_movement=0

; Adjust the movement speed on magtubes compared to regular roads.
; For example magtube_movement_rate=2 enables twice as fast movement than on roads.
; Setting this to 0 allows zero cost for magtube movement (vanilla default).
; Values greater than 3 may result in limited maximum speeds when used with high-speed units.
magtube_movement_rate=2

; Adjust how many movement points Choppers will expend upon every attack.
; The original game allows one attack for every available movement point.
chopper_attack_rate=2

; Allow reactivating skipped units on the same turn if they have not spent any movement points.
activate_skipped_units=1

; Probe team infiltration on other factions can expire after a time period when this is enabled.
; When infiltration is discovered and removed, a dialog box will be displayed for both factions.

; a fission reactor. More advanced reactors still provide their usual cost discounts.
; Planet busters are unaffected by this feature.
ignore_reactor_power=1

; Combat ships are always able to do artillery strikes. When Heavy Artillery is added
; as an optional special ability on ships, the range increases by this many tiles.
; This option is ignored when network multiplayer is active. Allowed values: 0-8.
long_range_artillery=0

; upgrade cost is twice mineral difference (miminum 1 mineral row) times unit energy hurry cost
; double for crawlers
; quadruple for upgrading to not prototyped unit
modify_upgrade_cost=1

; Modifies which additional unit types require mineral support.
; 0 = original defaults, 1 = crawlers need support, 2 = probe teams and crawlers need support.
modify_unit_support=2

; Modifies how territory borders are drawn on the map. In vanilla game mechanics, tiles
; that are equidistant between two different faction bases are claimed by the newest base.
; This patch makes the oldest base always claim those tiles. Coastal bases also expand
; territory into the ocean in a similar way compared to actual ocean bases.
territory_border_fix=1

; Automatically relocate lost headquarters to another suitable base.
auto_relocate_hq=1

; Normally hurrying base production will cost double if the accumulated minerals are
; less than the "Retool exemption" set in alphax.txt. This patch removes the penalty.
; It's recommended to leave this enabled if the exemption is raised from vanilla default.
simple_hurry_cost=0

; In vanilla game mechanics, eco damage on AI bases is notably reduced from player levels.
; This patch increases AI eco damage to the same level as what the player bases have.
; In addition, constructing Tree Farms and similar facilities always increases the clean
; minerals limit even before the first fungal pop.
eco_damage_fix=1

; Amount of minerals a base can produce before experiencing eco damage. This limit is also
; increased by one after each fungal pop or after building any of these facilities:
; Tree Farm, Hybrid Forest, Centauri Preserve, Temple of Planet.
