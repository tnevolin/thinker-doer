; Allow AI to spend energy reserves to hurry base production.

; Percentage multiplier to set how many bases the AI should have before it stops colony pod
; production entirely. The base limit is scaled to the map size and then multiplied by this
; percentage. Using expansion_factor=100, standard sized maps have a limit of 25 bases.
; Global base limit imposed by the game engine will always be 512 bases.
expansion_factor=100

; Thinker AI is only allowed to start secret projects if the human player does not 
; have their required techs when the difficulty level is above the specified value.
; Example: 0 = always allow starting SPs before the human player,
; 3 = apply limit on Talent level and below (vanilla behaviour),
; 6 = apply limit on all difficulty levels.

; ****** Game Engine Patches ******
; *** These apply to all factions regardless of factions_enabled setting. ***

; Set AI cost factors for mineral/nutrient production for each difficulty level respectively.
; When revised_tech_cost is enabled, this factor is also applied on AI research costs.

; Set the number of content base population for player/AI factions for each difficulty level.

; Alien Crossfire techs, units, facilities, or abilities will not be available.
; This can also be selected by a command line parameter, e.g. "terranx_mod.exe -smac"
; While it is still possible to select alien factions during the game setup, 
; it is not supported and may cause glitches.
; The following files must be placed in "ac_mod" folder for smac_only to work:
; alphax.txt, helpx.txt, conceptsx.txt, tutor.txt
smac_only=0

; Balance faction starting locations more evenly on random maps and 
; maintain a minimum distance to any nearest neighbors.
