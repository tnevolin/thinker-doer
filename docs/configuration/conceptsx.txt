#ADVCONCEPT16
The {Rainfall} level of a land region determines the amount of $LINK<Nutrients=10057> which
can be produced. A region can be arid, moderate or rainy, producing 0, 1, or 2
nutrients respectively. A $LINK<farm=90000> increases the nutrient production.
^
In addition to coastal and tropical regions, the western (upwind) slopes of mountain ranges
tend to be quite rainy, since warm moisture-laden air cools as it rises, and sheds
its moisture as rainfall. You can take advantage of this phenomenon by raising
hills to the east of your important bases. Conversely, areas east, or downwind of
mountain ranges tend to be quite arid.
^
Ocean squares produce 1 nutrient unless you cultivate a $LINK<kelp farm=90020>.
^
Special {Nutrient Resource} squares produce two extra nutrients, and
$LINK<Monsoon Jungle=10055> squares produce a single extra nutrient.

#ADVCONCEPT17
The {Rockiness} of an area determines that region's $LINK<Mineral=10058> production potential.
Regions can be flat, rolling, or rocky. {Flat} regions produce no minerals unless
a $LINK<mine=90002> is build there. {Rolling} regions
produce a single mineral, which can be increased with a mine. Unimproved {Rocky}
regions also produce 1, but can produce more with a mine and road.
^
Rocky areas inhibit movement, costing twice the normal number of moves to enter. They
also provide a modest defensive benefit in combat.
^
Ocean squares produce minerals only if you build a $LINK<mining platform=90022>.
^
Special {Mineral Resource} squares produce two additional minerals per turn, and
can be increased to three extra with a mine. $LINK<Crater=10055> squares also produce one extra
mineral.

#ADVCONCEPT18
The {Altitude} of a region affects the amount of $LINK<Energy=10059> which can be collected
there. To collect this energy, you must build a $LINK<Solar Collector=90003>.
It produces 1 unit of energy plus one more for each 1000m of altitude.
^
Ocean squares do not produce energy unless you build a $LINK<tidal harness=90023>.
^
Special {Energy Resource} squares produce two additional units of energy per turn. Squares
in the $LINK<Uranium Flats=10055> and $LINK<Geothermal Shallows=10055> produce one additional unit.


#ADVCONCEPT19
A {Pact of Brotherhood} (or {Pact of Sisterhood}) is the closest form of diplomatic
relationship you can form with another faction. Pact Brothers may enter each other's
territory freely, may stack with each other's units, and may enter each other's
bases (and receive repairs there).
^
Pact Brothers are expected to defend one another from enemy attack. They receive
{double} $LINK<commerce=10045> between their bases, and are often willing to share technological
research.
^
A Pact can be terminated at any time (the right-click menu on the {Commlink} menu
is one way to do it), but at the moment of termination all of your units will
automatically be shipped home from your former Pact Brother's territory, and vice
versa.

#ADVCONCEPT20
A {Treaty of Friendship} is intended to secure a permanent and lasting friendship
between two factions. Once you have signed a Treaty, you will receive $LINK<commerce=10045>
benefits with your new friends. You may not, without diplomatic repercussions,
enter the territory of a faction you have a Treaty with.
^
A Treaty of Friendship terminates only if one faction attacks another or
refuses a valid demand for withdrawal.

#ADVCONCEPT21
{Blood Truce} marks an end to Vendetta between two factions. It a promise not to
attack one another for a limited period of time. After about 15-20 years, a Blood
Truce will expire and the two factions will continue as Neutrals unless they again
attack one another.
^
Technically, Blood Truce does not restrict you from entering another faction's
territory, but other faction leaders may not see things that way.

#ADVCONCEPT22
{Vendetta} is a state of war between two factions. If you have pronounced Vendetta
on a faction (or another faction has pronounced it against you), expect to be
attacked.

#ADVCONCEPT23
{Integrity} measures the current value of your word-of-honor as a faction leader.
If you keep your promises and do not betray your friends, your integrity will remain
high. Attacking factions you have pledged $LINK<Blood Truce=10021> or signed
$LINK<Treaties=10020> with will
rapidly lower your integrity rating, and other faction leaders will no longer be
eager to make such agreements with you.
^
Note that there is no dishonor in attacking a sworn enemy with whom you have not
pledged Blood Truce; only breaking an agreement can lower your Integrity.

#ADVCONCEPT24
{Atrocities} comprise a set of particularly heinous acts forbidden under the
Unity mission's U.N. Charter. Simple Atrocities include use of nerve gas or
genetic warfare, nerve stapling of civilians, and attacks against civilian
populations (e.g. intentional obliteration of a base). Use of quasi-nuclear
devices such as Planet Busters is considered a Major Atrocity.
^
If you commit a Simple Atrocity, the other factions will likely impose
commerce sanctions for ten or more years, depriving you of all trade with your
Treaty and Pact partners. The faction against whom you committed the atrocity
will probably remain your sworn enemy forever.
^
If you commit a Major Atrocity, you will be expelled from the
$LINK<Planetary Council=10043> and
all factions will pronounce $LINK<Vendetta=10022> against you.
^
Simple atrocities committed between factions of different species (i.e., 
the $LINK<Progenitors=10063> and humans) do not invoke the wrath of other faction leaders.

#ADVCONCEPT25
{Drone Riots} occur when the number of $LINK<Drones=10052> at a base exceeds the number of
$LINK<Talents=10053>. During Riots, citizens will continue to feed themselves, but no production
will take place and no surplus energy will be produced. To end the Drone Riots, you
will have to restore the balance of Drones and Talents.
^
Drone Riots can be prevented (or ended) by one of several methods: (a) building
{psych-related facilities} such as $LINK<Recreation Commons=100006> will reduce the number of
Drones at a base (b) if your social engineering $LINK<POLICE=130005> rating is high enough, you
can place military units in your base to serve as "police" and impose order
(c) Converting some workers to {Doctors} will increase the number of Talents, balancing
out the drones.
(d) if your base produces enough energy, increasing your energy allocation to {Psych} will
increase the number of
Talents at your base (one talent for every two points of Psych produced), thereby
restoring balance.

#ADVCONCEPT26
A {Golden Age} occurs when a base has no $LINK<Drones=10052>, and
the number of $LINK<Talents=10053> at least
equals the number of regular Workers and Specialists.
^
A Golden Age significantly increases a base's {growth} rate and {energy} production--
equivalent of +1 $LINK<ECONOMY=130000> and +2 $LINK<GROWTH=130006> on the social
engineering table.

#ADVCONCEPT27
{Morale} reflects the training and experience of your military units. Morale levels
range from Very Green to Green to Disciplined to Hardened, Veteran, Commando, and
Elite. A unit receives a {+12.5% combat bonus} for each morale level. Morale plays
a particularly important role in psi combat, and in combat between probe teams,
since no weapon and armor values are considered in those cases.
^
New units typically begin with {Very Green} morale, though this may be higher or lower
depending on your social engineering $LINK<MORALE=130004> setting. A new unit's morale can also
be increased if a base has a $LINK<Command Center=100027> or similar morale facility.
^
Alien units such as Mind Worms have {life cycles} which correspond to morale
levels. Alien units are not affected by Command Centers and military facilities,
but their life cycle levels can be improved by building $LINK<Biology Labs=100009> and other
similar facilities. The {transport} capacity of an $LINK<Isle of the Deep=30009> is determined
by its life cycle level: one unit for each level.
^
A unit victorious in combat will often receive a morale upgrade.
^
{Elite} units receive a special bonus -- an additional move each turn.

#ADVCONCEPT28
{Monoliths} are mysterious and unexplained alien devices discovered on Planet.
A monolith will increase a unit's $LINK<morale=10027> (or life cycle) one level, but an individual
unit can receive only one monolith upgrade.
^
A monolith will also completely repair any damaged unit; this can be done any
number of times, even if a unit has already received a morale upgrade from a
monolith.
^
Monolith squares can also be tapped for resources, and will produce
$LINK<2 Nutrients=10057>, $LINK<2 Minerals=10058>, and $LINK<2 Energy=10059> each turn.

#ADVCONCEPT29
{Artifacts} are mysterious and unexplained alien devices sometimes discovered
on Planet. If you can find an artifact and return it to one of your bases, you
will have several options: (a) you can link it to a $LINK<Network Node=100008> if you have
one, and receive a free technology breakthrough; (b) you can use it to speed the
production of a $LINK<Secret Project=110102> or Unit Prototype; (c) you can save it to use
later.
^
Artifacts can be captured from other players. A lone artifact can be captured by
any player without diplomatic penalty.

#ADVCONCEPT30
{Xenofungus} or {Fungus} is a form of plant life native to Alpha Centauri. It
has a number of unusual properties which you may discover in the course of play.
Some of the more obvious properties include:
^
(1) Fungus impedes movement. Units may have difficulty entering Fungus squares.
Increasing your $LINK<PLANET=130007> social engineering rating will alleviate this problem. Building
the Xenoempathy Dome improves Fungus movement considerably.
^
(2) Fungus has some defensive value when defending against other human 
or $LINK<Progenitor=10063> factions. Against native $LINK<Mind Worms=30008>, 
however, Fungus has negative value.
^
(3) Fungus squares can be tapped for {resources}; the resource level provided by a
fungus square is determined by the number of $LINK<Centauri technologies=140006> you have
discovered.

#ADVCONCEPT31
Some units (usually alien creatures such as $LINK<Mind Worms=30008>) can engage in
{PSI COMBAT}. In Psi Combat, weapon and armor strengths are ignored.
$LINK<MORALE=130004> level becomes quite important in Psi Combat.

#ADVCONCEPT32
{Waypoints} can be set when giving a unit "go to" orders. One way to give a unit
"go to" orders is to click on it to activate it, then
hold down the {left mouse button and drag} a "movement arrow"
to where you want the unit to go. You can set waypoints by pressing the {SPACE BAR}
while the arrow is over a particular square. The unit will move to each of its
waypoints on its way to its final destination. You can also set waypoints while
giving a unit Patrol orders, in similar fashion.

#ADVCONCEPT33
A unit can be told to {Patrol} by clicking on the unit to activate it, then selecting
the Patrol option from the Action menu. When the Patrol cursor appears, hold down the
left mouse button and drag a "patrol arrow" to the area you wish the unit to patrol.
The unit will commence patrolling back and forth between its current location and the
location you have specified. It will "wake up" and request orders if it encounters
an enemy unit. You may set {waypoints} in a patrol by pressing the {SPACE BAR} while
you drag the patrol arrow.

#ADVCONCEPT34
The Explore, Discover, Build, and Conquer buttons on the Base
Control Screen activate the {Governor} for that base. When the
Governor is activated, he will make decisions automatically
based on his general instructions. This function is useful
for beginners and for players who do not wish to micromanage
their bases.
^
The {EXPLORE} button tells the Governor of a base to concentrate on
finding and occupying new territory. Bases set to explore
will typically concentrate on building $LINK<Scouts=30002>, $LINK<Colony Pods=30000>,
$LINK<Transports=30003>, and occasional $LINK<Naval Units=40003> for scouting oceans.
This button is especially useful early in the game, when
you need to expand quickly.

#ADVCONCEPT35
The Explore, Discover, Build, and Conquer buttons on the Base
Control Screen activate the {Governor} for that base. When the
Governor is activated, he will make decisions automatically
based on his general instructions. This function is useful
for beginners and for players who do not wish to micromanage
their bases.
^
The {DISCOVER} button on the Base Control Screen emphasizes scientific discovery and
technological breakthroughs. The Base Governor will concentrate on
building {Science Facilities} (such as $LINK<Network Nodes=100008>), $LINK<Secret
Projects=110102>, $LINK<Probe Teams=30006>, and $LINK<Prototype Units=10039>. This button
is especially effective with large, well-protected bases deep
in your interior.

#ADVCONCEPT36
The Explore, Discover, Build, and Conquer buttons on the Base
Control Screen activate the {Governor} for that base. When the
Governor is activated, he will make decisions automatically
based on his general instructions. This function is useful
for beginners and for players who do not wish to micromanage
their bases.
^
The {BUILD} button on the Base Control Screen mandates infrastructure and growth.
The Base Governor will tend to build {Facilities} and $LINK<Formers=30001>.
Use this button at
any time to have your base concentrate on peaceful growth.

#ADVCONCEPT37
The Explore, Discover, Build, and Conquer buttons on the Base
Control Screen activate the {Governor} for that base. When the
Governor is activated, he will make decisions automatically
based on his general instructions. This function is useful
for beginners and for players who do not wish to micromanage
their bases.
^
Use the {CONQUER} button on the Base Control Screen to build up your military.
In this mode
your base will produce {military units} of all varieties,
and their associated facilities, such as $LINK<Command Centers=100027>.
Use this button whenever you need to attack or defend.

#ADVCONCEPT38
Units which engage in combat may become damaged. Damage is indicated by
a colored bar along the left side of a unit's status icon: Green represents
light (or no) damage; Yellow and Red show increasing damage.
^
Damage can be repaired if a unit skips its entire turn (SPACE BAR) at
a friendly base. A severely damaged unit may have to repeat this
operation for several turns. NOTE: Damage will not be repaired on any
turn in which the unit is attacked or bombarded.
^
Units can also conduct "field repair" (i.e. not at a base), but this
process is much slower and is only effective if the unit has sustained
more than 10% damage.

#ADVCONCEPT39
You may use the Design Workshop screen to create new unit types.
Whenever you create a unit using a $LINK<weapon=60005>, $LINK<armor=70007>,
or $LINK<chassis=40006>
type which you have never used before, you must {prototype} this component.
^
A prototype component requires an extra {+100% Minerals} of its own cost to build.
^
Prototyped unit receives a bonus $LINK<+1 Morale=10027> upgrade in compensation since
experimental weapons are often given to crack, well-trained troops.
^
Once you have prototyped a new component, you may build units with this component at no additional cost.

#ADVCONCEPT40
When designing new units, bear in mind that units strong in
three areas ($LINK<weapon=60005>, $LINK<armor=70007>, $LINK<chassis=40006>)
will be vastly more
expensive than units strong in only two areas (or one).

#ADVCONCEPT41
As your colony grows and you claim more territory and build more
bases, this growth will put a strain on your economy. This strain
shows up as {inefficiency}, which can cause you to lose some of your
$LINK<energy=10059> production each turn.
^
The farther a base is away from your $LINK<Headquarters=100001> base, the more
inefficiency it will experience.
^
Inefficiency can be mitigated at all of your bases by making
social engineering choices which increase your $LINK<EFFICIENCY=130001> value.
$LINK<Democratic=120003> politics and $LINK<Green=120009> economics each increase efficiency.
^
Inefficiency can be mitigated at a particular base by building a
$LINK<Children's Creche=100002> there.

#ADVCONCEPT42
As humans or $LINK<Progenitors=10063> expand and build colonies on Planet, they inevitably begin
to cause ecological damage. Ecological damage can provoke the native
life forms and cause other unexpected effects.
^
The more $LINK<mines=90002>, $LINK<solar collectors=90003>, $LINK<roads=90005>,
and $LINK<farms=90000> (but not $LINK<forests=90004>,
which actually help the ecology) you build, the more the potential
damage. $LINK<Boreholes,=90014> $LINK<Mirrors,=90013> and $LINK<Condensers=90012> cause even greater damage. You can
reduce this type of damage by building $LINK<Tree Farm=100013>
and $LINK<Hybrid Forest=100014> facilities.
^
As your industrial output (minerals) increases, ecological damage
will also take place. This effect can be reduced by building the
$LINK<Centauri Preserve=100031>, $LINK<Temple of Planet=100032>,
and $LINK<Nanoreplicator=100020>
facilities.

#ADVCONCEPT43
Once you have obtained commlink frequencies for all factions, you can
convene the {Planetary Council} to vote on planetary policies, including
election of a $LINK<Planetary Governor=10044>.
^
In elections for Planetary Governor (and $LINK<Supreme Leader=10005>), each faction
casts votes equal to the total size of all its bases. This total may
be modified by faction powers and $LINK<Secret Projects=110102>. Only the leader of
one of the two factions with the highest vote totals may stand for
election as Governor or Supreme Leader.
^
On votes to set planetary policies, each faction receives one vote.
In these votes, the current Planetary Governor has veto power, which
can be overridden only by unanimous vote of all remaining factions.

#ADVCONCEPT44
The {Planetary Governor} holds an Executive Veto in all votes on Planetary
Policy. The Governor also receives {+1 Energy} in $LINK<commerce=10045> transactions
with other friendly factions at each base, from the
increased commerce created by global agencies. The planetary bureaucracy
provides the Governor with an infiltrator in every other faction.

#ADVCONCEPT45
{Commerce} is bonus energy generated from trade between two friendly
factions. Whenever you sign a $LINK<Treaty=10020> or $LINK<Pact=10019> with another faction,
your bases will automatically begin to accrue commerce (and this
benefit extends to your partner faction as well).
^
Commerce is interrupted whenever a $LINK<Vendetta=10022> occurs between two
factions, or when sanctions are applied against a faction which has
committed an $LINK<atrocity=10024>. Think of Commerce as a reward for peaceful
behavior.
^
Between two factions, commerce is more beneficial to the faction
which has discovered the most $LINK<Economic technologies=140045>. CEO Morgan
gains additional bonuses here as part of his faction power. Commerce
also tends to benefit the current $LINK<Planetary Governor=10044>.
^
^You can increase your commerce rates by doing the following:
^* Sign more Treaties.
^* Sign more Pacts (Pacts receive double commerce).
^* Increase the size and economy of your bases ("it takes energy to make energy").
^* Discover more economic-related technologies
^
Economic related technologies include $LINK<Industrial Economics=140045>, $LINK<Industrial
Automation=140046>, $LINK<Planetary Economics=140061>, $LINK<Industrial Nanorobotics=140073>,
$LINK<Sentient Econometrics=140075>, and $LINK<Environmental Economics=140059>.

#ADVCONCEPT46
There are five principal ways to win the game:
^
^$LINK<Transcendence Victory=10007>
^$LINK<Conquest Victory=10006>
^$LINK<Progenitor Victory=10014>
^$LINK<Diplomatic Victory=10005>
^$LINK<Economic Victory=10008>
^$LINK<Scenario Victory=10009>
^
For detailed scoring information, see $LINK<Scoring=10004>.
^
For information on retirement and mandatory retirement, see
$LINK<Retirement=10010>.

#ADVCONCEPT47
Your {territory} consists of all land nearer to one of your land bases
on the same continent than to anyone else's. Your territorial waters
consist of all sea areas nearer to one of your sea bases (in the same
ocean) than to anyone else's. Territory may move and shift during
the course of the game as bases are built, conquered, and destroyed.
^
Other faction leaders may take offense if you move units into their
territory, particularly if you have signed a $LINK<Treaty of Friendship=10020>.
^
Territory never extends more than 7 squares from a land base, or
3 from a sea base.

#ADVCONCEPT48
Your {might} is a measure of your overall standing in comparison to
other factions. It ranges from "Unsurpassed" (first place), to
"Feeble" (seventh place).
^
Might is based on a holistic evaluation of your faction, and includes
population, $LINK<technology=140080>, $LINK<secret projects=110102>, and military strength.
^
The {Faction Dominance} graphs on the information display track
might.

#ADVCONCEPT49
Fast units, such as Speeders and Hovertanks, can sometimes
{disengage} when surprised by slower enemy units. A unit disengages
when the following conditions are met:
^
^* Unit incurs 50% damage, relative to what it started the combat with.
^* Unit is faster than its attacker, taking initial damage into account.
^* Unit is alone in its square.
^* Unit did not attack on its last turn.
^* Unit is a combat unit (non-combat units may never disengage).
^* Neither attacker nor defender is an air unit.
^* Attacker does not have the $LINK<Comm Jammer=80009> ability.
^* Unit does not have the HOLD order, and is not in a $LINK<bunker=90007>
or $LINK<airbase=90008>.
^* A valid retreat square is avaiable, which is not a $LINK<fungus=10030> square (unless
$LINK<Pholus Mutagen=110086>) and is not adjacent to an enemy unit.

#ADVCONCEPT50
Any unit placed over land exerts a {Zone of Control} into adjacent land squares.
^
Land units may not normally move between two land squares in an enemy
zone of control, with the following exceptions:
^* Units may freely move into and out of bases.
^* Units may freely attack any adjacent unit.
^* Units may freely enter squares already containing friendly units.
^* $LINK<Probe teams=30006> and units with the $LINK<Cloaking ability=80002>
ignore zone of control.

#ADVCONCEPT51
Naval units, and land units with the $LINK<Heavy Artillery=80015> ability may
conduct {Bombardment} by selecting the Long Range Fire option from
the Action menu.
^
Bombardment damages every enemy unit in a particular square.
Maximum bombardment damage is 50% for unit in base or bunker, 99% for land unit on land, and 100% (lethal) for all others.
^
If bombardment is attempted against a square containing an enemy
naval or artillery unit, the bombardment is cancelled and an
{Artillery Duel} is initiated, with the attacking and defending
artillery (or naval) units fighting attack-vs-attack strength. Armor
values are ignored for Artillery Duels.

#ADVCONCEPT52
{Drones} are discontented, undereducated citizens which
appear as a result of population pressure and other social forces.
Drones work like other citizens, but if a base has more Drones than
$LINK<Talents=10053>, a $LINK<Drone Riot=10025> may result.

#ADVCONCEPT53
{Talents} are prosperous, highly educated citizens, your intellectual
elite. Talents are created as the result of favorable social conditions
and the diversion of energy to $LINK<Psych=10054>. As long as a base has at least
as many Talents as $LINK<Drones=10052>, no $LINK<Drone Riot=10025> will occur.

#ADVCONCEPT54
Energy diverted to {Psych} is used to improve the quality of life
your citizens experience. Every two units of energy diverted to Psych
will create an additional {Talent} in that base.

#ADVCONCEPT55
Certain major {Landmarks} on Planet's surface convey special bonuses:
^
^{Garland Crater} confers $LINK<+1 Mineral=10058> in interior squares.
^{Mount Planet} confers $LINK<+1 Mineral=10058> and $LINK<+1 Energy=10059> in each square around the mouth.
^{Uranium Flats} confer $LINK<+1 Energy=10059> in each square.
^{Geothermal Shallows} confer $LINK<+1 Energy=10059> in each square.
^{Pholus Ridge} confers $LINK<+1 Energy=10059> in each square.
^{Monsoon Jungle} confers $LINK<+1 Nutrient=10057> in each square.
^{Freshwater Sea} confers $LINK<+1 Nutrient=10057> in each square.
^{Fossil Field Ridge} confers $LINK<+1 Mineral=10058> in each square.
^{Manifold Nexus} confers a $LINK<+1 PLANET=130007> rating when inside a faction's borders. $LINK<Progenitor=10063> factions gain an additional $LINK<+1 RESEARCH=130010> rating.
^
Other landmarks have no effect beyond the standard effects of
the terrain which they represent.

#ADVCONCEPT56
The following proposals can be brought before the Planetary Council, once
appropriate technology is obtained:
^
^{Salvage Unity Fusion Core}: +500 energy for each faction
^{Global Trade Pact}: Commerce rates doubled planetwide.
^{Repeal Trade Pact}: Commerce rates return to normal.
^{Launch Solar Shade}: Global cooling; sea levels fall.
^{Melt Polar Caps}: Global warming; sea levels rise.
^{Repeal U.N. Charter}: Atrocity prohibitions lifted.
^
The Council also elects the $LINK<Planetary Governor=10044> by a majority
vote of population, and by a 3/4
vote by population can annoint a Supreme Leader, conferring a
$LINK<Diplomatic Victory=10005>.

#ADVCONCEPT57
{Nutrients} are produced in squares with sufficient $LINK<Rainfall=10016>, sometimes
supplemented by the addition of $LINK<Farms=90000> and similar enhancements.
^
Every citizen at a base must consume some number of nutrients per turn to survive.
^
Surplus nutrients are stored. When sufficient surplus nutrients have
been accumulated, a base will grow, producing a new citizen.

#ADVCONCEPT58
{Minerals} are produced in squares with sufficient $LINK<Rockiness=10017>, sometimes
supplemented by the addition of $LINK<Mines=90002> and similar enhancements.
^
Once a base has exceeded its free $LINK<SUPPORT=130002> level, any additional
units (military or non-combat) consume one Mineral per turn of support.
^
Surplus minerals are applied to production of $LINK<facilities=100029>,
units, and $LINK<secret projects=110102> which a base
is creating. When sufficient minerals are
accumulated, the facility or unit is built.

#ADVCONCEPT59
{Energy} is produced in squares with $LINK<Solar Collectors=90003>, particularly
those at high $LINK<Altitudes=10018>.
^
Depending on the Energy Allocation which you have made on the Social
Engineering screen, all the energy you produce is divided among three
priorities: $LINK<Economy=10060>, $LINK<Labs=10061>, and $LINK<Psych=10054>.
Some of the energy a base
produces may also be lost to $LINK<Inefficiency=10041>.

#ADVCONCEPT60
$LINK<Energy=10059> allocated to your {Economy} is added, as energy credits,
to your $LINK<Energy Reserves=10062>, which function as your treasury for monetary
transactions.

#ADVCONCEPT61
$LINK<Energy=10059> allocated to {Labs} is used to conduct scientific research.
The more energy you allocate to Labs, the quicker you will make technological
breakthroughs.

#ADVCONCEPT62
Your {Energy Reserves} represent stored energy. Your reserves function
as your treasury for monetary transactions.
^
Your energy reserves increase depending on the amount of $LINK<Energy=10059>
you allocate to $LINK<Economy=10060> on the Social Engineering screen.

#ADVCONCEPT0
Unit cost is defined by following factors:
^- Each more advanced reactor reduces weapon/armor cost by ~20%.
^- Primary component contributes its full cost.
^- Secondary component contributes half of its cost.
^- Chassis cost factor multiplies unit cost.
^- Ability cost factor multiplies unit cost and its flat cost added on top.
^
^The above result is rounded normally to get number of mineral rows.
^Minimum cost = Reactor power
^
^Special rules for non combat units:
^Colony, Former, Supply on foil/cruiser costs same as their infantry/speeder analogues.


#ADVCONCEPT1
The {Inefficiency} at base is computed as:
^
inefficiency = energy * hqDistance / maxDistance - energy * (4 + EFFICIENCY) / 8
^
Clumped at 0 to energy.
^energy | Amount of energy produced by base this turn.
^maxDistance | half of equatorial circumference
^hqDistance | Distance from $LINK<Headquarters=100001> base (maxDistance if no HQ).
^EFFICIENCY | $LINK<EFFICIENCY=130001> at base (+2 if $LINK<Children's Creche=100002>).

#ADVCONCEPT2
The ecological damage formula is complex:
^(1) For each base total the number of $LINK<Mines=90002>, $LINK<Solar
Collectors=90003>, $LINK<Farms=90000>,
$LINK<Soil Enrichers=90001>, $LINK<Roads=90005>, $LINK<Mag Tubes=90006>,
$LINK<Condensers,=90012> $LINK<Mirrors,=90013>
and $LINK<Boreholes=90014>. Items
in squares which are actually being worked count double.
^(2) Add an extra +8 for each Borehole, +6 for each Mirror, and +4 for each Condenser.
^(3) Subract 1 for each $LINK<Forest=90004>.
^(4) Halve for each $LINK<Tree Farm=100013> or $LINK<Hybrid Forest=100014>.
^(5) Divide this value by 8, and reduce by up to 16 plus # of previous
damages. Set this number aside.
^(6) Take the number of minerals produced this turn (but not from Orbit)
^(7) Divide minerals by 1 plus # of $LINK<Centauri Preserve=100031>,
$LINK<Temple of Planet=100032>,
$LINK<Nanoreplicator=100020>.
^(8) If result from 5 was reduced by less than 16+#, reduce result 7
by remaining amount.
^(9) Sum the values of (5) and (8), and add +5 for each major $LINK<atrocity=10024>.
^(10) If Alpha Prime is at perihelion (20 years out of every 80), double
your value.
^
^Ecology% = (ValueFromStep10) * Difficulty * Technologies * (3-PLANET) * LIFE / 300
^
^Difficulty = Normally 3, but 5 on two highest two difficulty levels.
^Technologies = Number of $LINK<technologies=140080> discovered
^PLANET = Social Engineering $LINK<PLANET=130007> value
^LIFE = Native life level (1-3) from Custom Start

#ADVCONCEPT3
Commerce is computed base by base between factions with $LINK<Treaties=10020> and
$LINK<Pacts=10019>, as follows:
^
^(1) First, all bases for each faction are ranked from top to bottom by Energy output.
^(2) Bases are paired off from top to bottom. If one faction has extra bases, these are ignored.
^(3) For each pair of bases, sum the combined economic output and divide by 8, rounding up.
^(4) Double this value if a Global Trade Pact is in effect.
^(5) Now, for each individual base, the commerce formula is as follows:
^       (ValueFromStep4) * (CommerceTech+1) / (TotalCommerceTech+1)
^(6) CommerceTech is the total # of economic technologies discovered, plus
faction & social bonuses.
^(7) TotalCommerceTech is the total # of economic technologies in the game.
^(8) Now, using the value from step 5, divide by 2 if no Pact (e.g. only a Treaty)
^(9) Add +1 if you are $LINK<Planetary Governor=10044>.
^(10) Reduce to zero if sanctions are in effect against either faction.

#ADVCONCEPT4
Your Alpha Centauri Score is computed as follows:
^
^(1) 1 point for each citizen of each base.
^(2) If you have won a $LINK<Diplomatic=10005> or $LINK<Economic=10008> victory, score:
^        (a) 1 point for each citizen of a $LINK<Pact Brother's=10019> base.
^        (b) 1/2 point for each citizen of any other faction's base.
^(3) 1 point for each citizen of a surrendered base.
^(4) 1 point for each unit of $LINK<commerce=10045> your bases are receiving.
^(5) 1 point for each $LINK<technology=140062> discovered.
^(6) 10 points for each $LINK<Transcendent Thought=140088> advance.
^(7) 25 points for each $LINK<Secret Project=110102>.
^(8) A $LINK<Victory=10046> bonus if you have won the game.

#ADVCONCEPT5
You may win the game diplomatically by convincing enough faction
leaders to unite behind you as Supreme Leader of Planet. A 3/4 vote
of the $LINK<Planetary Council=10043> is required to secure such election.
Only the leader of one of the two factions with the highest vote totals
may stand for election as $LINK<Governor=10044> or Supreme Leader.
^
When a Supreme Leader is elected, a faction leader may choose to defy the will
of the Council and refuse to submit. In this case, the Supreme Leader
must, with the help of loyal factions, conquer all defiant factions
to achieve a Conquest victory. Because of the military power usually
required to secure election as Supreme Leader, defying the will of the
Council is generally fairly suicidal. Other factions will therefore
usually only take this course if you have committed atrocities against
them or grossly and repeatedly betrayed them.
^
If you win a Diplomatic Victory, you are awarded 1200 points minus
2 for every game turn elapsed. If Cooperative Victory is enabled and
your $LINK<Pact Brother or Sister=10019> is elected Supreme Leader, you are awarded
half this total.
^
No leader can win a diplomatic victory so long as any Progenitor faction remains 
unconquered.

#ADVCONCEPT6
You may win the game by conquest if you eliminate all remaining
factions. Factions which surrender and "swear a pact to serve you"
count as eliminated for this purpose. If Cooperative Victory is
enabled, you need not eliminate any faction with whom you have signed a
$LINK<Pact of Brotherhood=10019>, though aside from surrendered AI factions
no more than three factions may "win together" in this fashion.
^
For winning by Conquest, you are awarded 1000 points minus 2 for
every game turn elapsed. If Cooperative Victory is enabled and more
than one faction survives the game, the points are split between them
based on relative population.

#ADVCONCEPT7
The highest form of victory is the Ascent to Transcendence, the next
step in the evolution of sentient life. In order to ascend, you must complete
the secret project $LINK<Ascent to Transcendence=110102>, which can be started only
after one faction has completed the $LINK<Voice of Planet=110101> project.
^
Players who ascend to transcendence are awarded 2000 points minus
2 for every game turn elapsed. If cooperative victory is enabled,
all $LINK<Pact Brothers and Sisters=10019> participate in the win, and points
are split between all winning factions based on relative population.

#ADVCONCEPT8
You may win an Economic Victory by cornering the Global Energy Market.
You must have discovered $LINK<Planetary Economics=140061> in order to pursue such
a plan.
^
Cornering the Global Energy Market will require a sum of energy credits
roughly equal to the cost to "mind control" every remaining base on
Planet. When you are ready to make such an attempt, select "Corner
Global Energy Market" from the HQ Menu.
^
When a faction attempts to corner the Global Energy Market, all other
factions will be given an allotted period of time in which they can
capture or destroy the cornering faction's $LINK<Headquarters=100001> and thereby
foil the plan.
^
For Economic Victory, you are awarded 1200 points minus 2 for
every game turn elapsed. If Cooperative Victory is enabled, $LINK<Pact Brothers
and Sisters=10019> of the winning faction receive half the bonus points.

#ADVCONCEPT9
You win a Scenario Victory if you successfully complete the goals
of a Scenario. Your score will depend on the specific scenario rules.
^
You cannot win a Scenario Victory if you are playing a standard game.

#ADVCONCEPT10
You may retire as faction leader at any time by selecting "Retire"
from the Game Menu. This ends the game and computes your $LINK<Alpha Centauri
Score=10004>.
^
You must also retire if you reach the mandatory retirement year for
your game or scenario. In standard games, the mandatory retirement
year is M.Y. 2600 for Citizen, Specialist, and Talent levels, and
M.Y. 2500 for Librarian, Thinker, and Transcend levels.
^
You will be warned 20 years before you reach mandatory retirement.

#ADVCONCEPT11
The formula used to compute a faction's might is as follows:
^
^4  points for each point of population
^4  points for each $LINK<Transcendent Thought=140088>
^?? points for each $LINK<Tech=140062> (sum of Explore, Discover, Build, Conquer values)
^10 points for each $LINK<Secret Project=110102>
^
^For each non-combat unit, add Cost/40 (technically MineralRows/4)
^For each psi unit, add Cost/20 (MineralRows/2)
^For each planet buster, add Cost/10 (MineralRows)
^For combat units, add Cost/10 in ratio of weapon strength to best
^  weapon of any unit currently in the game.
^
^So a 2-1-2 unit is only worth half value if "4" weapons are the best available.

#ADVCONCEPT12
Several factors contribute to the number of $LINK<drones=10052> found at a base
before $LINK<police=130005>, $LINK<facilities=100029>, $LINK<psych=10054>, 
and $LINK<secret projects=110102> are taken into account:
^
(1) Difficulty Level: at the lowest difficulty level, every citizen
after the first six is a drone. For each increase in difficulty level,
an additional drone is added, so at the highest level every citizen
after the first one is a drone.
^
(2) Bureaucracy: depending on your $LINK<EFFICIENCY=130001> and your difficulty
level, you will receive additional drones when your {number of bases}
exceeds a certain number. See $LINK<BUREAUCRACY=10013>.
^
(3) Disloyal Citizenry: for approximately 50 turns after you capture
an enemy base, you will receive extra drones while you assimilate the
enemy citizens. The basic rate is 5 drones minus one for each 10
turns elapsed, but the number may never exceed:
^^(BaseSize + Difficulty - 2)/4
^
(4) Faction Power: Some factions receive additional drones or talents.
For instance, the University receives an extra drone for every 4 citizens
(rounded down), while the Peacekeepers receive an extra $LINK<Talent=10053> for every
4 citizens, rounded up.

#ADVCONCEPT13
{Bureaucracy} is the addition of extra Drones because a faction has
exceeded a certain number of bases. The bureaucracy formula works
as follows:
^
^^BaseLimit = (8 - Difficulty) * (4 + Efficiency) * MapRoot / 2
^
^Where:
^Difficulty = Player's difficulty level (0 - 5)
^Efficiency = Social Engineering $LINK<Efficiency=130001> rating.
^MapRoot    = Sq. Root of # Map Squares / Sq. Root of 3200.
^
For each base a faction builds in excess of this number, one additional
drone will appear at some base somewhere in the colony.

#ADVCONCEPT63
The {Progenitors} are a highly advanced race of starfaring creatures, whose technological
sophistication is evident in the $LINK<artifacts=10029> and $LINK<monoliths=10028> they left behind on Planet. 
Research into these structures, or direct contact with the Progenitors should they return, can
yield new technologies, weapons, and base facilities. 
^
In recent millenia, the Progenitors have split into two warring camps: the $LINK<Manifold 
Caretakers=150006> and the $LINK<Manifold Usurpers=150007>. These factions conflict over 
the uses of the $LINK<Manifolds=10065>, which include Planet. The Caretakers wish to leave
the Manifolds in their original, pristine state, while the Usurpers wish to initiate and
control an $LINK<Ascent to Transcendence=10007>. If either faction is successful in their
quest, it most likely means an end to humanity's presence on Planet.

#ADVCONCEPT64
The $LINK<Progenitors=10063> have evolved complex biological systems that can sense fields
imperceptible to humans, including at least electrical and magnetic fields. The collective
term for this sensitivity is {resonance}, and permeates all Progenitor communication, art, 
and culture. The sensitivity also confers valuable combat bonuses to Progenitor forces. 
With a great deal of training and mechanical aid, humans can learn to sense and
utilize this resonance as well.

#ADVCONCEPT65
Eons ago, the ancient $LINK<Progenitors=10063> constructed six Planetary {Manifolds}, which they
intended as massive experiments into sentience on a gigantic scale. One of the Manifolds,
in the Tau Ceti system, achieved an early sentience, gaining the ability to project 
undreamt-of power across the galaxy. The "Flowering", as this event was called, engulfed 
numerous star systems and plunged Progenitor culture into a dark age from which it has not
fully recovered. In the ensuing millenia of chaos and fragmentation, the locations of the 
Six Manifolds were lost.

#ADVCONCEPT66
$LINK<Progenitor=10063> factions do not engage in $LINK<commerce=10045> with humans. However, 
their experience with recycling does provide them with an {Energy Grid} at each base. Each
Progenitor base facility is connected to this grid; every two base facilities generate
one energy added to the base total, rounded up. Every two $LINK<Secret Projects=110102> generate 
five energy added to the base total.
^
$LINK<Nerve Stapling=10024> causes widespread disaffection among Progenitor citizens, 
resulting in the shutdown of the Grid for a limited time.

#ADVCONCEPT67
{Population Boom} allows base growing by 1 every turn as long as there is enough food for new citizens and population limit is not reached.
^
Population Boom is triggered at base by following conditions:
^- Base is in $LINK<Golden Age=10026>
^- Base $LINK<GROWTH=130006> rating is at least 6

#ADVCONCEPT14
The two $LINK<Progenitor=10063> factions can achieve victory by calling in reinforcements from 
their respective homeworlds. To broadcast the hidden location of the $LINK<Manifold=10065> to
their leaders offworld, either Progenitor faction can construct a {Resonance Communicator}.
The Communicator consists of six $LINK<Subspace Generators=100040>, which must be built in bases of size
ten or greater. 
^
Players who build the Resonance Communicator are awarded 2000 points minus
2 for every game turn elapsed. No cooperative victory is possible for this victory condition;
if either Progenitor faction succeeds in the completion of such a Communicator, it
heralds the end of human habitation on Planet.

#ADVCONCEPT15
{Subversion} basic cost = 30 * unit cost
^modifiers:
^  * (2 - distance to HQ / (map width / 4)), if HQ is closer than (map width / 4)
^  * (1 + number of units with PE on same or adjacent tiles)
^  * (2), for colony and former
^
{Mind Control} basic cost is the sum of below
^  8 * each surplus nutrient
^  8 * each surplus mineral
^  4 * each economy, psych, lab
^  10 * each facility cost
^  80 * each SP cost
^modifiers:
^  * (2 - distance to HQ / (map width / 4)), if HQ is closer than (map width / 4)
^  * (4 ^ ((talents - drones) / population))
^  * (1 + (0.1 * (previous MCs + previous subversions / 4))
^  / (2), if base previously belonged to probing faction
^diplomacy modifiers:
^  * (2), if base faction is an atrocity victim of probing faction
^  OR
^  * (1.5), if base faction wants revenge against probing faction
^
^ {Corner market} cost calculation uses the above value.
^ {Mind Control} also adds the cost of all subverted units on top of that.

#CONCEPT0
Welcome to {The Will to Power} mod!
^
^This mod optimizes and balances different game features making them more comparable to each other. It increases number of viable strategies, makes game more variative and replayable.
^
^Main focus areas
^- Rule fixes and simplification
^- Overall game balance
^- AI improvement
^- Bug fixes
^- QoL features
^
^This datalinks section highlights only conceptual changes. Specific feature changes can be found in corresponding datalinks articles.

#CONCEPT1
Feature should do what it claims to or be disabled if impossible to fix (Deep Pressure Hull).
^
^Feature should respect game concepts or be disabled if impossible to fix (resonance weapon/armor).
^
^Rules should be comprehensible for the player and produce an expected effect. OG unit cost for 10-1-1 (5) and 1-10-1 (20) is an example of bad design.
^
^Balance extremely OP or underpowered strategies. Each one should be viable and has its niche or be disabled if impossible to fix and use.
^
^Features should appear at the right moment when they are needed.
^
^Replaceable items (weapon, armor) should appear in progressive succession to let each one to play their part.
^
^Generally features (items, strategies, social choices) should have competitive cost and effect to allow multiple viable choices.

#CONCEPT2
Minimal modifications to match game concept changes and for general balance.
^
^- University of Planet: Extra RESEARCH.
^
^- Spartan Federation: Reduced EFFICIENCE.
^
^- Lord's Believers: {+50%} fanatics bonus.
^
^- Cybernetic Consciousness: Reduced bonuses (balance).
^
^- AQUATIC factions: No bonus minerals from water.
^
^- Data Angels: Severe research penalty to balance inherent Planetary Datalinks. Probe teams are available from start.
^
^- Cult of Planet: Reduced POLICE. Their Mind Worms still have double police power.
^
^- Alien factions: INDUSTRY penalty. No free Recycling Tanks.

#CONCEPT3
Technology links and dependencies are moderately modified in this mod to make appearence time of different features more sensible.
^At the same time it tries to keep technology names and they major unlocked feature the same as much as possible to relate to vanilla experience.
^
^- Techs are more evenly distributed by levels. Player starts with just handful techs and gradually makes their way up.
^
^- Techs are priced by their level preventing trading abuse.
^
^- Doctrine: Flexibility is the first level technology available to be researched at start.
^
^- Weapons and armors are discovered in progressive manner to allow them advance side by side.
^
^- Energy Bank and Network Node are moved to higher levels as they are not usable until bases yield enough energy.

#CONCEPT4
Society effects changes are described in corresponding effect articles.
^
^Social models are minimally modified for balance.
^- Most models now have 4 effects to increase variativity.
^- Use of effects is adjusted to account for their applicable range.
^- TALENT effect is now unlocked and is used in few models.

#CONCEPT5
Various combat changes.
^
^- Reactor does not increase unit hit points and instead makes it slightly cheaper down to half with the lastest one.
^- Weapon offence and Armor defense are progressing together alloweing defense to play its role.
^- Combat round odds are fixed to reflect displayed odds. OG bug.
^- Base defenses are smoothens up: intrinsic = {+50%}, first level = {+100%}, first + second levels = {+150%}.
^- Artillery can damage tougher units those it could not in OG.
^- Morale bonuses are simplified greatly. No quirky bonuses from home and current base, CC/BP.
^- Promotion probability is equalized across the whole spectrum to avoid abuse.
^- Interceptor applies its Air Superiority bonus while defending as well.
^- Ground units can attack needlejet in flight without Air Superiority.

#CONCEPT6
Unit cost is completely reworked toward simplification and adopting Civ 1/2 progression.
^
^- Reactor does not change combat unit hit points but reduces its cost by ~20%.
^- Base weapon/armor cost is equal to its strength.
^- Unit with equal weapon and armor strength is {50%} more expensive.
^- Chassis multiplies unit cost. Faster units are usually {50%} more expensive.
^- - Sea chassis cost {combat/probe}: foil = speeder, cruiser = hovertank.
^- - Sea chassis cost {non combat}: foil = infantry, cruiser = speeder.
^- Abilities may multiply the cost as in OG or they may add flat cost.
^- PB, Tectonic/Fungal {cost} is proportional to their reactor power.
^- Probe armor cost is halved.
^- Prototype cost applies to the new {item}, not the whole unit.

#CONCEPT7
Terraforming changes.
^
^- No resource yield restrictions.
^- Base nutrient box width is increased to 20.
^- Farm gives {+2} nutrients.
^- Forest terraforming time is {doubled}.
^- Borehole produces {0-2-6}.
^- Fungus yield is reworked to focus more on {nutrients} and {energy}.

#CONCEPT8
Subvertion pulls unit to the probe tile allowing subverting from stack.
^
^Polymorphic Encryption increases subversion cost for all stacked and adjacent units.
^
^Infiltration expires and can be renewed/prolonged any time.
^
^Introduce Genetic Plague probe action is now much more riskier.
^
^Mind control cost accurately summarizes all factors:
^- Surplus resources: nutrient, mineral, energy
^- Secret projects and facilities
^- Proportional distance to HQ
^- Gradual citizen happiness (not just binary riot switch)
^- Subversion cost of all flipped units

#CONCEPT9
Eco damage forumula is adjusted to match description and to make more sense.
^Industry effect reducing facilities (Centauri Preserve, Temple Of Planet, and others) proportionally raise base eco friendly mineral production limit.

#CONCEPT10
Base psych is reworked to simplify rules and avoid abuses.
^
^- All happiness computations are simplified and work similar to psych: one psych power improves citizen education by one level.
^- Psych facilities and police have extra power but spend two powers to quell superdrone.
^- Psych is applied last to avoid redundancy with other effects and unleash its full power, but is twice less effective.
^- Specialists do not affect happiness computation and are not displayed on the base psych breakdown screen.
^- Specialists converted from sufficiently educated citizens (normals and talents) after happiness is computed.
^- Base credits may be converted to psych to educate enough citizens as needed for specialists conversion.

#CONCEPT11
Road doubles movement and magtube triples.
