; Allow AI to spend energy reserves to hurry base production.

; Percentage multiplier to set how many bases the AI should have before it stops colony pod
; production entirely. The base limit is scaled to the map size and then multiplied by this

; Thinker AI is only allowed to start secret projects if the human player does not 
; have their required techs when the difficulty level is above the specified value.

; ****** Game Engine Patches ******
; *** These apply to all factions regardless of factions_enabled setting. ***

; Set AI cost factors for mineral/nutrient production for each difficulty level respectively.
; When revised_tech_cost is enabled, this factor is also applied on AI research costs.

; Alien Crossfire techs, units, facilities, or abilities will not be available.
; This can also be selected by a command line parameter, e.g. "terranx_mod.exe -smac"
; While it is still possible to select alien factions during the game setup, 
; it is not supported and may cause glitches.
; The following files must be placed in "ac_mod" folder for smac_only to work:
; alphax.txt, helpx.txt, conceptsx.txt, tutor.txt
