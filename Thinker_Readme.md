SMACX Thinker Mod
=================

Thinker is an AI improvement mod for Alpha Centauri: Alien Crossfire.
This mod increases the level of challenge in single player while providing many gameplay enhancements.
By patching the game to use an additional DLL, many new features can be developed in C++.

* Vastly improved production/movement AI
* Visual changes on map rendering and random map generation
* More config options for many previously fixed settings in the game engine
* Additional options for resolution settings and other user interface features
* Some automation features are also available for player factions
* Mod also includes [Scient's patches](Details.md)

This mod is tested to work with the [GOG version](https://www.gog.com/game/sid_meiers_alpha_centauri) of Alpha Centauri.
Note that official Alien Crossfire patch version 2.0 must be installed for the launcher to work with terranx.exe.
Older game version 1.0 is NOT supported by Thinker. Installing Scient's patch v2 also works since this terranx.exe can be used by the launcher.

[See more information](Details.md) about the features and recommended settings.
It's strongly recommended to read Details.md as many features provided by the mod are not present in the vanilla game.
[Discuss here](https://github.com/induktio/thinker/discussions) about anything related to Thinker development.

Installation
------------
1. Extract the files to Alpha Centauri game folder. Alphax.txt changes are optional.
2. Check Changelog.md and Details.md for useful information.
3. Change configuration from thinker.ini or just use the defaults.
4. Start the game from thinker.exe.
5. Press ALT+T to open Thinker's options menu. Other option is to check that mod version/build date is visible in the game version menu (CTRL+F4).
6. If neither of those options display mod version, Thinker is incorrectly installed and not loaded.


Troubleshooting
---------------
The launcher requires original Alien Crossfire v2.0 terranx.exe in the same folder but this file is not modified on disk.
In case of startup problems, make sure the official v2.0 patch is applied on the game, and the mod is actually started
from same folder with the game. Sometimes startup issues can be fixed by starting the launcher with administrator privileges.

Alt-tabbing may sometimes not work by default in Alpha Centauri's GOG version. To re-enable alt-tab feature, follow these steps.
First open a command prompt with administrator privileges in Alpha Centauri's installation folder. After entering the commands
below alt-tabbing should now work when the game is restarted.

    sdbinst -u game.sdb
    sdbinst -u game_add.sdb

After installing the game on Windows there might be a notification that Windows Features can't complete the requested changes.
This might be caused by a failure to install DirectPlay. First open a command prompt with administrator privileges.
Then after entering the command below DirectPlay should be automatically installed.

    dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:DirectPlay /All


Other mods
----------
* [SMAC-in-SMACX mod](Details.md#smac-in-smacx-mod) can be installed to play a game similar to original SMAC while Thinker is enabled.
* [OpenSMACX](https://github.com/b-casey/OpenSMACX) is a long-term project to decompile and create a full open source clone of SMACX.
* Also see [compatibility with other mods such as PRACX](Details.md#compatibility-with-other-mods).
