SMACX Thinker Mod
=================

Thinker is an AI improvement mod for Alpha Centauri: Alien Crossfire.
This mod increases the level of challenge in single player while providing many gameplay enhancements.
By patching the game to use an additional DLL, new functionality can be developed in C++. Most important features include:

* Vastly improved production/terraforming AI
* Improved code for AI social engineering choices
* AI combat units are rewritten to use more variety in tactics
* AI deploys colony pods much sooner instead of wandering on the map
* AI builds more crawlers and deploys them better
* More config options for many previously fixed settings in the game engine
* Many enhancements to random map generation/spawn locations
* Name labels for HQ bases are emphasized on the map
* Does not affect player-run factions (with some exceptions)
* Minimal changes to vanilla game mechanics
* Game binary includes [Scient's patches](Details.md)

This mod is tested to work with the [GOG version](https://www.gog.com/game/sid_meiers_alpha_centauri) of Alpha Centauri.
[More information](Details.md) about the features and recommended settings.

* [Release versions](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qsps5bhz8v020o9/AAAp6ioWxdo7vnG6Ity5W3o1a?dl=0&lst=)


Installation
------------
1. Extract the files to Alpha Centauri game folder.
2. Check the Changelog for release notes.
3. Change configuration from thinker.ini or just use the defaults.
4. Start the game from terranx_mod.exe
5. Mod version/build date should now be visible in the game version menu (Ctrl+F4). If it is not displayed, Thinker is not correctly loaded.


Other mods
----------
* [SMAC-in-SMACX mod](Details.md#smac-in-smacx-mod) can be installed to play a game similar to original SMAC from the SMACX game binary while Thinker is enabled.
* [PRACX](https://github.com/DrazharLn/pracx) graphics enhancement patch can be used together with Thinker. Note that since v2.3 some of these features are [included with Thinker](Details.md#compatibility-with-other-mods). For easiest installation, download [version 1.11 or later](https://github.com/DrazharLn/pracx/releases/). If you already use older Pracx 1.10 you can just rename terranx_mod.exe to terranx.exe and run pracxpatch.exe so that the installer patches the right binary.
* [OpenSMACX](https://github.com/b-casey/OpenSMACX) is a long-term project to decompile and create a full open source clone of SMACX.


Compiling
---------
Thinker can be compiled with GCC using the included CodeBlocks project. GCC version 8.1.0 or later is recommended.
To avoid compiling issues, do not use the MinGW toolkit version bundled with CodeBlocks.
Instead get the toolkit separately from the [MinGW-w64 project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/mingw-w64/mingw-w64-release/).
