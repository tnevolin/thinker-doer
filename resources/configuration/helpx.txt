#;POLITICS
#HELPSOC0
The "Politics" social category allows you to choose your basic
political system.
^
^$LINK<Frontier=120001>
^$LINK<Police State=120002>
^$LINK<Democratic=120003>
^$LINK<Fundamentalist=120004>

#;Frontier
#HELPSOC00
Frontier politics represent the informal governing arrangements made
in early colonies, before populations reach levels requiring more
advanced forms of government. Frontier politics provides no bonuses
or penalties.
^
^Prerequisite: NONE

#;Police State
#HELPSOC01
Police States use oppression to keep their citizens in line, and allow
their leaders great power over military decisions. But oppression of
this type also decreases economic efficiency.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Democratic
#HELPSOC02
Democracies allow citizens to participate in government, and forego
oppression and the stability it confers in favor of growth and efficiency.
But citizens remain suspicious of large military deployments, and civilian
oversight creates large military bureaucracies, so military support
costs increase.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Fundamentalist
#HELPSOC03
Fundamentalist politics unite a society behind a strong, dogmatic
religion. Evangelizing the populace can create loyal, even fanatical
military forces, and tends to immunize citizens against (other forms
of) brainwashing, but technological research tends to suffer under the
continual assaults on intellectual integrity associated with such
regimes.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>


#;ECONOMICS
#HELPSOC1
The "Economics" social category allows you to control the way your
economy is managed.
^
^$LINK<Simple=120006>
^$LINK<Free Market=120007>
^$LINK<Planned=120008>
^$LINK<Green=120009>

#;Simple
#HELPSOC10
Simple Economics describes the informal, ad hoc economy which develops
in the early years of planetfall, before more organized economic
systems can be put in place. Simple Economics provides no special
benefits or penalties.
^
^Prerequisite: NONE

#;Free Market
#HELPSOC11
Free Market Economics turns market forces loose in your society.
Unfettered market economics can produce great wealth quickly, but
in the context of Planet's fragile emerging economies can also lead
to extremes of pollution and ecological damage. Also, citizens rendered
suddenly poor by the actions unscrupulous moguls may revolt against
their energy-fattened masters.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Planned
#HELPSOC12
A semi-market economy kept in check by fierce governmental regulation,
Planned Economics promotes stable industrial and population growth, but
sacrifices efficiency.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Green
#HELPSOC13
Green Economics strive to integrate sentient progress with the needs
of the biosphere. Green economies use resources efficiently and
tend to avoid the excesses of industrial development which could
provoke Planet's native life, but population growth necessarily
suffers for lack of space.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;VALUES
#HELPSOC2
The "Values" social category allows you to set major priorities for
your society.
^
^$LINK<Survival=120011>
^$LINK<Power=120012>
^$LINK<Knowledge=120013>
^$LINK<Wealth=120014>

#;Survival
#HELPSOC20
Survival is of course the all-encompassing first priority of early
human or $LINK<Progenitor=10063> space colonies. "Survival" as a priority provides no
special bonuses or penalties.
^
^Prerequisite: NONE

#;Power
#HELPSOC21
Leaders seeking Power build strong, well-paid military forces to
enforce their will. But Economic and industrial infrastructure may
suffer from bloated "defense" budgets.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Knowledge
#HELPSOC22
Leaders seeking Knowledge and intellectual enlightenment will pour
resources into research and education. They will also tend to promote
the free exchange of information, which increases efficiency but also
carries greater security risks.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Wealth
#HELPSOC23
Leaders seeking Wealth will concentrate on building economic and
industrial infrastructure rapidly. They achieve rapid growth and
development, with possible side effects being decadence and moral
decay.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;FUTURE SOCIETY
#HELPSOC3
Future Societies show speculatively how society may evolve
in the far future.
^
^$LINK<None=120016>
^$LINK<Cybernetic=120017>
^$LINK<Eudaimonic=120018>
^$LINK<Thought Control=120019>

#;None
#HELPSOC30
"None", or no Future Society, simply means that your society has not
yet evolved to a far future society. No bonuses or penalties apply.
^
^Prerequisite: NONE

#;Cybernetic
#HELPSOC31
In the far future, citizens may turn many of the tasks of governing
society over to artificially intelligent computers, increasing
efficiency and freeing individuals for more creative tasks. But will
workers displaced by computers sink into despair, poverty, and
possible unrest?
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Eudiamonic
#HELPSOC32
Perhaps the most pleasant to contemplate living in, this far future
society takes its name from an ancient Greek word for fulfillment
and happiness. Eudaimonic society encourages each citizen to achieve
happiness through striving to fulfill completely his or her potential.
Population, Economy, and Industry all experience healthy growth.
Violence fades as society grows more tolerant and just, and even when
this society's hand is forced it often shoots to subdue rather than
to destroy.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Thought Control
#HELPSOC33
The ultimate in "Big Brother" methods, Thought Control effuses
subtle neurochemical triggers into the atmosphere to render its
population obedient, loyal, and resistant to outside ideas.
But significant resources are required to maintain this level
of control.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

ECONOMY, EFFIC, SUPPORT, TALENT, MORALE, POLICE, GROWTH, PLANET, PROBE, INDUSTRY, RESEARCH

#;ECONOMY
#HELPEFFECT0
{ECONOMY} represents the raw strength of your society's economy.

and explore Planet.
^
Needlejets must return to a friendly base or airbase every other turn
for refueling.

#CHASSISDESC6
{Copters}, with their maneuverability and ability to land temporarily
in rough terrain, make formidable combat units.
^
Copters should return to a friendly base or airbase at the end of

control, thus throwing enemy mobile offensives into confusion. A Comm
Jammer confers a {+25%} defense bonus against ground units with more
than one move ($LINK<Speeders=40001> and $LINK<Hovertanks=40002>).

#ABILDESC10
{Antigrav Struts} give a unit an extra move each turn, and allow all
ground units, like $LINK<Hovertanks=40002>, to avoid movement penalties
for difficult terrain.
^
Air units with Antigrav Struts gain moves equal to twice their reactor
value (so an Antigrav air unit with a $LINK<Fusion reactor=50002>
would gain 4 moves).

#ABILDESC11
The {Empath Song} ability confers a +50% attack bonus against units
which employ a Psi Defense, such as $LINK<Mind Worms=30008>
and other alien creatures.

#ABILDESC13
{Fungicide Tanks} allows a terraformer unit to clear $LINK<Xenofungus=10030>
at twice the normal rate. Only $LINK<terraforming=30001> units can use this
ability.

#ABILDESC14
The {High Morale} ability gives a unit a $LINK<+1 morale=10027> upgrade when it
is first created.

#ABILDESC15
{Heavy Artillery} units bombard their targets from a distance rather
than attacking them directly. This unique ability allows them to fire
at units up to two squares away, and to attack every unit in a square
with one attack.
^
An artillery unit's only weakness is its inability to attack by
any other means than $LINK<bombardment=10051>.
^
Note that naval units have the intrinsic ability to conduct
bombardment, but they may also attack directly against units in
sea squares.

#ABILDESC16
Units with the {Clean Reactor} ability require no support from their
home bases.

#ABILDESC17
The {Blink Displacer} ability allows a unit to ignore all base
defenses ($LINK<Perimeter Defense=100004>, $LINK<Tachyon Field=100005>)
when attacking.

#ABILDESC18
Units with the {Hypnotic Trance} ability are insulated from Psi
attack, and thus receive a +50% defense bonus when attacked by
units which employ $LINK<Psi Combat=10031>, such as $LINK<Mind Worms=30008>
and other alien creatures.

#ABILDESC20
Faction leaders willing to commit atrocities can equip their combat
units with {Nerve Gas Pods.} Units so equipped can employ these pods
to gain a +50% attack bonus. If employed against a populated area,
Nerve Gas Pods will cause significant civilian casualties.

#ABILDESC21
A {Repair Bay} allows transport units to repair the units they carry
while in transit.

#ABILDESC22
{Non-Lethal Methods} grants a unit an extra police power (each unit eliminates three $LINK<drones=10052> rather than two).

#ABILDESC12
{Polymorphic Encryption} doubles all stacked and adjacent friendly units resistance to probe team
subversion.

#ARMORDESC
A unit's {armor} strength determines its combat strength when attacked.
The stronger the armor the better the defense.

#REACTORDESC
A unit's {reactor} reduces unit cost by {~20%} for each more advanced model.

#HELPFAC39
+50% defense against $LINK<conventional missiles=60023> for any units up
to two squares away.  Also, if you have no $LINK<Orbital Defense Pods=100068>, the system can shoot down
a non-conventional missile ($LINK<Planet Busters=60016>, $LINK<Tectonic Missiles=60024>, 
and $LINK<Fungal Missiles=60025>) 50% of the time when used inside a two-square radius of 
the base. Both effects are cumulative; i.e., if there are two Flechette Systems within a two-square 
radius of a missile's target, then a missile has only a 25% chance of success. 

#; Subspace Generator
#HELPFAC40
This is the main component of the Resonance Communicator used by $LINK<Progenitor=10063> 
factions to broadcast Planet's location to their respective forces. Once a Progenitor 
faction constructs six Generators in bases of size 10 or higher, the Communicator calls a fleet 
of reinforcements, thereby ending human habitation on Planet with 
a $LINK<Progenitor Victory=10014>.

#; Geosynchronous Survey Pod
#HELPFAC41
This base's sighting radius increases to three squares. The pod also acts as 
a $LINK<sensor array=90009>, conferring corresponding combat bonuses. Geosynchronous Pods may 
be destroyed by $LINK<Orbital Defense Pods=100068> or $LINK<Probe Teams=30006>.

#; The Manifold Harmonics

#ABILDESC24
Units equipped with {Soporific Gas Pods} reduce enemy conventional unit morale by 2 when attacking.

#ABILDESC25
Units equipped with a {Dissociative Wave} can counter special abilities that modify
combat percentages. This nullifys specials such as the $LINK<Comm Jammer=80009> 
and $LINK<Hypnotic Trance=80018>. 

#ABILDESC26
Sea units equipped with a {Marine Detachment} can board and capture enemy ships that 
have been severely damaged. 

#ABILDESC27
{Fuel Nanocells} add {+2} to an air units speed and {+4} to sea unit speed.

#ABILDESC28
$LINK<Probe Teams=30006> equipped with {Algorithmic Enhancement} perform covert operations 
with greater chances of success. Enhanced Probe Teams can also infiltrate bases and units 
regardless of social engineering choices or $LINK<The Hunter-Seeker Algorithm=110085> Secret 
Project, although they still have a high rate of failure.

#UNITDESC14
{Sealurks} haunt the fungal patches and ocean depths of Planet's seas. As opposed to the
less aggressive $LINK<Isles of the Deep=30009>, the Sealurks seek out and attack
ocean and coastal bases. They may also lie in wait for 
easy prey, catching unwary ships that travel too close to $LINK<fungus=10030>. When immobile,
these creatures are extremely hard to detect until they begin their attack.

Sealurks can engage in $LINK<Psi Combat=10031> when attacked,
in which weapon and armor strengths are ignored.
$LINK<Morale=10027> level is quite important when attacking Sealurks.
^
With proper breeding and bonding techniques, Sealurks can
also be bred in captivity and controlled by skilled brood trainers.
Like any native unit, players can also release Sealurks into the wild, to harass and
disrupt an enemy.

#UNITDESC15
{Spore Launchers} can appear singly or in the company of $LINK<Mind Worms=30008>, 
and are closely associated with $LINK<fungus=10030>. Spore Launchers tend to lurk
on the outskirts of a settlement, expelling bursts of corrosive spores that can 
destroy manmade or Progenitor improvements from a range of two squares away. These 
spores are also effective against units.
^
Spore Launchers can engage in $LINK<Psi Combat=10031> when attacked,
in which weapon and armor strengths are ignored.
$LINK<Morale=10027> level is quite important when attacking Spore Launchers.
^
With proper breeding and bonding techniques, Spore Launchers can
also be bred in captivity and controlled by skilled brood trainers.
These captive boils can be used as artillery to attack enemy units or terrain improvements.
Like any native unit, players can also release Spore Launchers into the wild, to harass and
disrupt an enemy.

#UNITDESC16
{Battle Ogres} are rare, mechanical remnants of the first $LINK<Progenitor=10063> era on Planet. 
Several different types of Ogres may be found, each with advanced equipment and 
powers. Unfortunately, the convoluted engineering of these units makes it impossible 
for them to be repaired even by Progenitor technicians; any damage taken is permanent.
^
The Battle Ogre Mk1 possesses a $LINK<Resonance Laser=60012>, $LINK<Resonance 3 Armor=70011>, and 
a $LINK<Fission Reactor=50001>. Its awesome size and fearsome appearance also help quell 
drone activity, effectively doubling the $LINK<police=130005> powers of the Ogre.

#UNITDESC17
{Battle Ogres} are rare, mechanical remnants of the first $LINK<Progenitor=10063> era on Planet. 
Several different types of Ogres may be found, each with advanced equipment and 
powers. Unfortunately, the convoluted engineering of these units makes it impossible 
for them to be repaired even by Progenitor technicians; any damage taken is permanent.
^
The Battle Ogre Mk2 possesses a $LINK<Resonance Bolt=60013>,  
$LINK<Resonance 8 Armor=70013>, and a $LINK<Fusion Reactor=50002>. Its awesome size and fearsome appearance also 
help quell drone activity, effectively doubling the $LINK<police=130005> powers of the Ogre. The 
Progenitors also built the Mk2 Ogre with the $LINK<Dissociative Wave=80025> special ability.

#UNITDESC18

The Battle Ogre Mk3 possesses a $LINK<String Disruptor=60014>, $LINK<Stasis Generator Armor=70008>,
and a $LINK<Quantum Chamber=50003>. Its awesome size and fearsome appearance also 
help quell drone activity, effectively doubling the $LINK<police=130005> powers of the Ogre. The 
Progenitors also built the Ogre with the $LINK<Dissociative Wave=80025> special ability.

#UNITDESC19
{Fungal Towers} act as a localized nervous system for $LINK<fungus=10030> patches.
These Towers are massive, jumbled tangles of Mind Worms, fungus, and other strange native
life forms. Although the Towers cannot move or attack, they block movement through their
terrain and exert a $LINK<zone of control=10050> that can impede units in the area. 
^
When attacked, the Fungal Towers can engage in $LINK<Psi Combat=10031>,
in which weapon and armor strengths are ignored.
$LINK<Morale=10027> level is quite important when attacking Fungal Towers. When attacked, Fungal
Towers receive a 50% bonus due to their ability to co-ordinate and direct native life forms in the area.
^
The size and power of Fungal Towers depends on the amount of fungus adjacent to the Tower.
Towers can also generate fungus in nearby empty squares.

#UNITDESC20
The U.N.S. Unity contained a few of these lasers, intended for rudimentary mining 
operations. One or two might have survived the Unity's descent onto the surface of Planet. 
In the first few years following Planetfall, these can be used as weapons in a pinch.

#WEAPONDESC12
The {Resonance Laser} functions both as a laser and a powerful disruptive force on 
local resonance fields. Its base attack factor is 6, and it receives a +25% bonus 
when engaging in a $LINK<psi attack=10031>.

#WEAPONDESC13
The {Resonance Bolt} functions both as a $LINK<Tachyon Bolt=60007> and a powerful 
disruptive force on local resonance fields. Its base attack factor is 12, and it 
receives a +25% bonus when engaging in a $LINK<psi attack=10031>.

#WEAPONDESC14
A unit's {weapon} strength determines its combat strength it attacks.
The more powerful the weapon the stronger the attack. 

#WEAPONDESC24
The {Tectonic Payload} weapons package can be used to create
Tectonic Missiles. It can be used only with the $LINK<Missile=40008>
chassis.
^
A Tectonic Missile detonation causes an earthquake that raises the target terrain by 1-4
level of altitude, depending on the $LINK<reactor=50001> type. A Fission reactor raises the terrain one level, 
a Singularity reactor up to four levels. Tectonic missiles are considered 
delivery platforms instead of combat units, and so may not target bases or units.

#WEAPONDESC25
The {Fungal Payload} weapons package can be used to create
Fungal Missiles. It can be used only with the $LINK<Missile=40008>
chassis.
^
A Fungal Missile detonation destroys any improvements in the square. Additionally, the
detonation covers 1-4 squares of terrain with fungus, depending on the $LINK<reactor=50001> type. A Fission
reactor covers one square, a Singularity reactor four squares. The detonation may also trigger
native life forms from dormant spores. Fungal Missiles are considered 
delivery platforms instead of combat units, and so may not target bases or units.

#ARMORDESC9
{Psi Defense} armor confers the same defensive ability possessed by native units 
such as $LINK<Mind Worms=30008>. A unit equipped with psi defense engages in $LINK<psi combat=10031>
when attacked, in which weapon and armor strengths are ignored, and the attacker
is given a 3 to 2 advantage on land. $LINK<Morale=10027> level is quite important when
attacking a unit equipped with psi defense.

#ARMORDESC10
{Pulse 3 armor} is a combined-defense system that gives the benefit of $LINK<Plasma Steel 
armor=70002> (D3) and confers a 25% defense bonus against ground units with more
than one move ($LINK<Speeders=40001> and $LINK<Hovertanks=40002>).

#ARMORDESC11
{Resonance 3 armor} combines the physical protection of $LINK<Plasma Steel 
armor=70002> (D3) with a psi shield that confers a +25% defense bonus when 
attacked by units which employ $LINK<Psi Combat=10031>, such 
as $LINK<Mind Worms=30008> and other alien creatures.

#ARMORDESC12
{Pulse 8 armor} is a combined-defense system that gives the benefit 
of $LINK<Neutronium Armor=70006> (D8) and confers a 25% defense bonus 
against ground units with more than one move ($LINK<Speeders=40001> 
and $LINK<Hovertanks=40002>).

#ARMORDESC13
{Resonance 8 armor} combines the physical protection 
of $LINK<Neutronium Armor=70006> (D8) with a psi shield that confers
