# Version 225

* Increased military production priority. Hopefully, this will make AI build more units.
* Energy market crash is multiplying energy reservers by 3/4 now, not 1/4 as it was in vanilla.

# Version 224

* Design workshop display unit cost in rows.

# Version 223

* Sea transport delivers scouts to pods.

# Version 222

* Invokes hostile action vendetta dialog when commlink is established. Vanilla did not invoke it for non-combat hostile actions without pact/treaty/truce.

# Version 221

* AI removes fungus/rockiness when settles in such places.

# Version 220

* Fixed partial hurry cost computation that was off sometimes due to rounding problems. It is still can be off sometimes but will err on safe side.

# Version 219

* Merged with Thinker 2.5.

# Version 218

* Added orbital_yield_limit parameter to limit orbital yield proportional to base population. I have left it as 1.0 currently as I don't believe satellites are that OP in end game. Suggestions are welcome.
* Reverted orbital facilities to their vanilla order of appearance. I have reconsidered my view on them and now I believe that nutrient satellites are less OP of them all.
* Further doubled orbital facilities cost to the level of small global SP. I believe it is fair as they produce similar faction global effect. Now it will take a significant investment to harvest a benefit.

# Version 217

* Reverted road movement ratio to 3. Anything other than will probably throw player off.
* Reworded odds confirmation dialog. Hopefully should be much clearer now.
* Roads/tubes can be used only on own or ally territory with right of passage.
* When faction looses a base (captured or killed) all terrain improvement on lost territory are destroyed.

# Version 216

* Fixed interceptor scrambling. https://github.com/tnevolin/thinker-doer#scrambling-interceptor-fix

# Version 215

* Disabling territory bonus temporarily to see how it behaves.
* Tech cost computation is simplified by reusing game variables. It is not stored in save anymore reducing risk of multiplayer corruption.

# Version 214

* Reinstated alien faction offense and defense bonuses. Not sure they need to be crippled even more.
* Reinstated fanatic attack bonus to 50%. Also not sure Believers are too powerful with it.

# Version 213

* Integrated few more changes from Thinker.

# Version 212

* Corrected odds computation for unequal HPs.
* Updated multiplayer configurations.
* Set road movement rate to 2 and tube movement rate to 4.

# Version 211

* Restored terraforming functionality.
* Restored anti-native combat functionality.
* Restored transport functionality.
	* Transports pickup artifacts, colonies, formers from sea bases.
	* Transports deliver them to sensible destinations.

# Version 210

* Massively modified display odds dialog.
	* Vanilla odds are corrected to account for ignored reactor in combat.
	* An exact computer simulation winning odds are added as well for reference.
	* An exact computer simulation winning chances are added as well for reference.

# Version 209

* Merged with updated Thinker code (no version).
* AI factions are allowed to build bases in fungus and rocky tiles.

# Version 208

* Merged with Thinker 2.4.
	* A lot of code changes. I have fixed some but there could be others lurking around. Please use caution and report any problems.

# Version 207

* Sea transport delivers colony and former to proper landmass.

# Version 206

* BUG: Late starting factions (aliens and Planet Cult) never got their extra colony. Now they do.
* Modified base placement search algorithm.
	* Searches wider area.
	* Accounts for potential yield (farm+mine, farm+solar).
	* Emphasizes extra high yield tiles.
	* Tries to minimize base radiuses overlap.
	* Tries to keep base radiuses connected to minimize land waste.
	* Prefers coastal sites.

# Version 205

Further SE models tuning.

# Version 204

* BUG: Air transport can unload in flight with keyboard shortcut or right action menu. Fixed.

# Version 203

* BUG: Right click long range fire option allowed land artillery to fire from transport. Fixed.

# Version 202

* Group terraforming option: group_terraforming.

# Version 201

* Fanatic bonus = 25.
* Believers do not have PLANET penalty.
* Aliens do not have combat bonuses.

# Version 200

* Alternative upgrade cost is disabled by default.
* Individual unit upgrade does not require full movement points and does not consume them upon upgrade.

# Version 199

* Habitation facilities functionality seriously changed.
	* Explicit population growth limit is removed. Bases can grow beyond the limit when not in stagnation.
	* Base without habitation facility receives -3 GROWTH penalty when at limit. Penalty gets higher with higher population.
	* Base with habitation facility receives GROWTH bonus for each citizen below the limit but no more than +3.
	* Habitation facilities maintenance is increased by 50% comparing to vanilla.
* Added visual aid to base nutrient display.
	* Header displays: (faction GROWTH) base GROWTH => nutrient box width. Much easier to understand numbers at work. No need to count bricks with mouse anymore.
	* Footer displays clear indication of pop boom (when GROWTH rating is above max) and stagnation (when it is below min).
	* Lighter text color and bolder font makes it more readable now. It was real pain to my eyes before.

# Version 198

* Removed +50% fungal tower defense bonus effect display in combat effects list.

# Version 197

* Exposed turn until aliens fight at half strength in thinker.ini: aliens_fight_half_strength_unit_turn.

# Version 196

* Removed +50% fungal tower defense bonus. Configuration parameter: remove_fungal_tower_defense_bonus. They don't need it anymore with 1:1 land psi combat odds.

# Version 195

* RESEARCH bonus percentage parameter is added in thiker.ini: se_research_bonus_percentage.
* RESEARCH bonus is doubled.
* Fundamentalist,  Brain,    ++MORALE,    ++PROBE,      +INDUSTRY,  --RESEARCH. It loses extra RESEARCH penalty which was added previously just because RESEARCH bonus was too weak.

# Version 194

* Knowledge,       Cyber,    ++EFFIC,    --PROBE,     +++RESEARCH. Lost GROWTH penalty and some RESEARCH bonus.
* University gets +3 RESEARCH.
* Also removed test effects in Frontier.

# Version 193

* Also made lines in SE description help window more compact to fit 5 effects as well (down-left when player hover mouse over SE choice).

# Version 192

* Display compact effect icons in SE dialog to fit 5 of them in model description. Off by default because it also requires large icons redesign.

# Version 191

* Display TALENT effect in SE dialog. Only for SE choices! Max buttons and faction inherent bonuses are not changed. Currently using some ugly icon waiting for better design.

# Version 190

* FIX: Vanilla counted only predefined colonies for purpose of player elimination computation which caused some aquatic factions to be incorrectly eliminated. Now it counts all of them.

# Version 189

* FIX: Game now requests to breaking a treaty before goind into combat stuff preventing many treaty related bugs. Setting: break_treaty_before_fight. Off by default due to unknown consequences.

# Version 188

* Sensor bonus applies on ocean and on attack. Exposed options.

# Version 187

* Territory bonus = 25%.
* Sensor defense bonus = 25%.
* AI constructs sensors on land and sea.
* Sensor confers defense bonus on sea too.

# Version 186

* Added ability cost explanation to the end of the ability selection rows in workshop.

# Version 185

* FIX: Bombarding empty square with adjacent enemy artillery exhausted attacker movement points and initiated artillery duel resulting in imminient and untimely attacker death. Fixed.

# Version 184

* FIX: Sea unit directly attacking sea unit stack would pick a defender with higher weapon rather than higher armor. Fixed.

# Version 183

* BUG: Extra prototype cost was not reduced to zero for factions with free prototype bonus.

# Version 182

* BUG: Sometimes tech cost is stored as zero in savegame. Didn't find why it happened but added a safety code that overrides it with some small positive value when calculated for F2 screen.

# Version 181

* Configuration option to allow AI deviate from its social priority choice (social_ai_soft_priority). Turned off by default.

# Version 180

* BUG: Accumulated minerals scaling to changed INDUSTRY rating didn't account for mid turn retooling. Fixed. https://github.com/tnevolin/thinker-doer/issues/36

# Version 179

* FIX: Probe expelled from other faction territory was sent to largest population base which could be not appropriate for sea probes. Now probes are sent to **closest** base and for sea probes they also should be connected to same region so it should not get stranded on land or magically appear in another ocean. If such base cannot be found the probe is killed.

# Version 178

A lot of ASM code redone. May break some previously working functionality related to hurrying and minerals. Proceed with caution.

* Exposed hurry cost multipliers for all categories.

# Version 177

* Computer player won't buy technology from human player when explicitly offered if they don't have enough cash.

# Version 176

* Infiltrate Datalinks option is always available even if already infiltrated.
* Infiltrate Datalinks option displays number of currently planted infiltration devices.
* Infiltrating Datalinks sets number of infiltration devices to the maximum regardless of current device number.

# Version 175

* Hooked up probe actions. Now I can set risks for them manually.
  * Set Itroducting Genetic Plague action risk to 2 (was 0 in vanilla). Now Disciplined and Hardened probes cannot even succeed in it without opponent negaitve PROBE help.
* Put risk values on all probe team action options. This allows roughly estimate success chances.

# Version 174

* Computer players do not lose their infiltration.
* Human player to human player infiltration lasts 20 turns on average.
* Human player to computer player infiltration lasts 60 turns on average.

# Version 173

* Infiltration expiration is not broken into multiple steps providing slightly more predictable infiltration lifetime and more insigth for player.

# Version 172

* Changed infiltration expiration configuration parameters to lifetime based instead of probability.

# Version 171

* Updated infiltration expired dialogs text.

# Version 170

* Infiltration may randomly expire every turn. Infiltrated faction PROBE rating increases probability in exposing infiltrator.
  * infiltration_expire
  * infiltration_expire_probability_base
  * infiltration_expire_probability_probe_effect_multiplier

# Version 169

* Pact bases display production on a map.

# Version 168

* BUG: Base production prototype cost was incorrectly calculated.

# Version 167

* AI expansion demand algorithm. The populatable tile weight is now reduced by distance quadratically, not linearly as before to reduce the need to populate whole planet.
* AI unit move algorithm now manages sea explorers without order.
  * Send to other connected ocean region through connected base (own or allied).
	* Disband immediatelly if there is nothing more to explore in this region to save on support.
* ai_production_expansion_priority=1.0. Experimental settings to see how it affects expansion.
* Introduced more fine grained control on when WTP production suggestion beats default one (Vanilla + Thinker). Added thresholds for each category.
  * ai_production_vanilla_priority_unit=0.50
  * ai_production_vanilla_priority_project=1.00
  * ai_production_vanilla_priority_facility=0.25
* Adjusted terraforming resouce priorities. Previously it was too high on minerals IMHO.
  * ai_terraforming_nutrientWeight=1.00
  * ai_terraforming_mineralWeight=1.25
  * ai_terraforming_energyWeight=0.75
* Synchronized MP configuration. Sorry, it gets behind sometimes.

# Version 166

* Removed Combat bonus: Infantry vs. Base. Attacker does not need any more economical advantage. Infantry is still preferrable for base attack since it is cheaper.
* Increased native life generation frequency. Now it will be 2-5-8 by levels (vanilla was 2-4-6).
  * native_life_generator_constant=2
  * native_life_generator_multiplier=3
* Reinstated "natives doesn't die" parameters. This alone should slightly increase native pressure.
  * native_disable_sudden_death=1

# Version 165

* Introduced negative ability values into unit cost calculation.
* Introduced (010000000000 = Cost increased for land units) ability flag into unit cost calculation.
* Deep Radar is free for sea/air and 1 for land.
* Air Superiority is free for sea/air and 1 for land.


# Version 164

* Wealth,          IndAuto,   +ECONOMY,   --MORALE,     -PLANET,    ++INDUSTRY. Replaced POLICE penalty with PLANET one.

# Version 163

* Reverted all native life generator parameters to vanilla. Native life should be back to normal.
  * native_life_generator_constant=2
	* native_life_generator_multiplier=2
	* native_life_generator_more_sea_creatures=0
	* native_disable_sudden_death=0

* Scaled tech cost up a little. It seems that research are coming in too quick succestion. This'll also give some value back to RESEARCH.
  * tech_cost_scale=1.25

# Version 162

* Partial hurry option in hurry dialog displays addition information on minimal hurry cost to completion.

# Version 161

* Police State: replaced -INDUSTRY with -GROWTH. People say former is to harsh penalty for it.

# Version 160

* Removed: Combat units are reassigned to avoid oversupport. Configuration parameter: unit_home_base_reassignment_production_threshold.\
Apparently, this is too narrow focused fix that breaks AI in other areas. Not worth it.

# Version 159

* BUG: Too long line in help entry caused game crash. Fixed Tachyon Field, Growth, Industry entries.

# Version 158

* Added build support and installation step for multiplayer configuration files.

# Version 157

* BUG: Version 150: Alien Artifact is cached at base contributing to project or prototype production. \
That didn't actuially contributed anything due to incorrect ASM sequence. As warned! :)\
Should be fixed now. At least I have tested the case with not first base and with some existing accumulated minerals.

# Version 156

Cancelled.

# Version 155

Cancelled.

# Version 154

* Disabled enhanced native life generator. Now it is back to vanilla values. Players still can turn on on by using these properties: native_life_generator_constant, native_life_generator_multiplier.

# Version 153

* Added configuration option for former wake fix: fix_former_wake.

# Version 152

* BUG: Forgot to revert Pressure Dome maintenance back to 0 when detached Recycling Tanks functionality from it.

# Version 151

* Spore Launcher cost = 8. Otherwise people prefer to build it for defense. They should be equal in price with other low psi unit types.

# Version 150

**Experimental**

*Original functionality is scattered across the code and is heavily hardcoded. This modification may make game crash or display incorrect results.*

* All direct mineral contributions are scaled to basic mineral cost multiplier in alphax.ini. That effectivelly ignores INDUSTRY rating impact on such contributions.
  * Alien Artifact is cached at base contributing to project or prototype production.
  * Unit is disbanded at base contributing to current production. This is actually already scaled in vanilla so no changes were needed.
  * Hurrying production. Hurrying cost is not dependent on INDUSTRY rating anymore.

# Version 149

**Experimental**

*Original functionality is scattered across the code and is heavily hardcoded. This modification may make game crash or display incorrect results.*

* [Flat extra prototype cost](https://github.com/tnevolin/thinker-doer#flat-extra-prototype-cost) formula is enabled by flat_extra_prototype_cost parameter in thinker.ini.

# Version 148

* Redid (FIX: Formers regained their moves after cancelling new terraforming action when old one just completed this turn.) to use patch instead of custom function. More concise this way.

# Version 147

* Increased tech cost steepness. Recent modification made research progress very fast.

# Version 146

This one lists both #145 and #146 changes. They were mixed up and I could not sort them out. This is only in description. Code wise this version includes everything.

* AI:
  * AI builds some facilities.
  * AI builds formers when needed.
  * AI builds explorers when needed.
  * AI builds colonies when needed.
  * AI builds native protectors and police.
  * AI suggests production for new bases.
* Global production hurry happens before production phase to produce fully completed items.
* FIX: Thinker production unit mineral cost calculation. Previously it didn't account for prototypes/Skunkworks and Brood Pit.
* Added predefined units: Trance Formers, Trance Sea Formers.
* Hab Complex is now enabled by FldMod (level 2). Sea and jungle bases still struggle to get it in time.
* Restored vanilla emergency retooling after base attack. That was previously overridden by Thinker.
* FIX: Sea explorers were stuck in land port. Now they are force kicked out of it.
* FIX: Formers regained their moves after cancelling new terraforming action when old one just completed this turn. They don't anymore. (Reported by MercantileInterest)

* Reduced cost of late mineral facilities. Otherwise, it is pretty difficult to reach the mineral intake when they become beneficial. Here I also listed the mineral intake when they roughly becomes beneficial.

| facility  | cost | mineral intake |
| ---- | ----:| ----:|
| Recycling Tanks | 6 | 8 |
| Genejack Factory | 12 | 24 |
| Robotic Assembly Plant | 18 | 48 |
| Quantum Converter | 24 | 80 |
| Nanoreplicator | 30 | 120 |

# Version 145

* AI: Added land improvement demand computation.
* Global production hurry happens before production phase to produce fully completed items.
* Fixed Thinker production unit mineral cost calculation. Previously it didn't account for prototypes/Skunkworks and Brood Pit.
* Added predefined units: Trance Formers, Trance Sea Formers.
* Hab Complex is now enabled by FldMod (level 2). Sea and jungle bases still struggle to get it in time.
* Restored vanilla emergency retooling after base attack. That was previously overriden by Thinker.
* AI production: added multiplying facilities.
* AI production: added psych facilities.
* AI production: added population limit facilities.

# Version 144

* Borehole Square,  0, 2, 6.
* Exposed condenser and enricher fix parameter: condenser_and_enricher_do_not_multiply_nutrients.

# Version 143

* [https://github.com/tnevolin/thinker-doer/issues/3]. HSA now exhausts probe team movement points.

# Version 142

* Modified expansion parameters to build proportional number of colonies.

# Version 141

* Enhanced Thinker threat computation. Previously sealurks scared land colonies away.

# Version 140

* BUG: Didn't check map boundaries when iterated through adjacent tiles. That crashes game when base is placed on map border.

# Version 139

* All Brood Pit morale effects are disables same way as for Children Creche.

# Version 138

* AI:
  * Fine tuned colony production in small bases to see if they have enough population issue it at completion.
  * Fixed exploration calculations to account for combat units explorers only.
  * Former redundant order are cancelled so they do not create improvement that is already there.

# Version 137

* AI:
  * Set production exploration demand.
  * Adjusted produciton expansion demand based on range to destination and availabe settlement room.

# Version 136

* Merged with scient's 2.1 help.

# Version 135

* Weapon help always shows cost even if it equals to firepower.

# Version 134

* Rearranged facility priorities: submerge protection, defense, population limit, psych, growth, mineral, project, energy, fixed labs.
* Discouraged building colonies in base size 1.
* Biology Lab costs 4 and produces 4 labs. Without that it seems to be not desirable early choice. Extra labs bonus will diminish later on with higher technology cost anyway.

# Version 133

* AI tuning.
  * Psych facilities are considered if drones outnumbers talents or there are doctors.
  * Psych facilities list is extended to FAC_RECREATION_COMMONS, FAC_HOLOGRAM_THEATRE, FAC_PARADISE_GARDEN
* Added multiplayer text files folder.
* Updated help text for The Planetary Transit System.
* Added configuration parameter for The Planetary Transit System new base size: pts_new_base_size_less_average.

# Version 132

* AI tuning.
  * Bases do not build units taking too much time. Configuration parameter: ai_production_unit_turns_limit.

# Version 131

* FIX: Captured base now properly receives free facilities from both capturing and captured factions. Didn't work in vanilla.

# Version 130

* AI base production and unit movement adjustment.
  * Base tries to build native protection if insufficient.
  * Unit in the base tries to hold to maintain native protection.
  * Base tries to build colonies if there is room for colonization.
* BUG: Battle status summary alignment messes up with Hasty and Gas modifiers. Feature removed.

# Version 129

* Experimental nutrient balance version #3.
  * Citizen nutrient intake = 2. Reverted to vanilla.
  * Farm nutrient bonus = 2 (both land and ocean).
  * Nutrient cost multiplier = 15.
  * Base Square produces 2 nutrients.

# Version 128

* Returned -1 Nutrient effect in mine square. This is in addition to nutrient balance. Otherwise some landmark mines produce too much nutrients.

# Version 127

* Further refinement to ZoC rule. Unit ignores ZoC only if target tile is occupied by own/pact unit that does not ignore ZoC by itself: probe, cloaked, air.

# Version 126

* Experimental nutrient balance version #2.
  * Citizen nutrient intake = 2. Reverted to vanilla.
  * Farm nutrient bonus = 2 (both land and ocean).
  * Nutrient cost multiplier = 15.
  * Base Square produces 1 nutrient.

# Version 125

* Returned Cloaking device into game: cost = 2, enabled by Quantum Computers.

# Version 124

* Unit cannot ignore ZoC moving to the tile occupied by friendly unit. Configuration option: zoc_move_to_friendly_unit_tile_disabled.

# Version 123

* Experimental nutrient balance version.
  * 1,       ; Nutrient intake requirement for citizens
  * 15,      ; Nutrient cost multiplier
  * Base Square,      1, 1, 1, 0,

# Version 122

* Ocean tiles depth is modified upon world build. Configuration option: ocean_depth_multiplier.

# Version 121

* SE reworked a little.\
http://alphacentauri2.info/wiki/Social_Engineering_Mod

# Version 120

* Experimental boost to specialists.

| specialist | output |
| ---- | ---- |
| Technician | 4, 0, 0 |
| Engineer | 5, 0, 1 |
| Librarian | 0, 0, 4 |
| Thinker | 0, 1, 5 |

# Version 119

* BUG: Tile yield calculation didn't set base. That caused crash for tile yield computation with collector on it and adjacent mirror when base is not set sometimes. Strangely it didn't bite me earlier.

# Version 118

* AAA bonus vs. air units = 50%.
* AAA Tracking ability cost = 1.

# Version 117

* Pressure Dome does not imply Recycling Tanks anymore. 
* [removed] Extra energy reserves to aquatic factions to support initial Pressure Dome maintenance.

# Version 116

* Extra energy reserves to aquatic factions to support initial Pressure Dome maintenance.

# Version 115

* BUG: Ignore independent units in reassignment code.

# Version 114

* Combat units are reassigned to avoid oversupport. Configuration parameter: unit_home_base_reassignment_production_threshold.

# Version 113

* Simplification in PTS functionality: https://github.com/tnevolin/thinker-doer#the-planetary-transit-system.

# Version 112

* AI build more defensive units based on: the combined strength of enemy attacking units, their distance from own bases, the diplomatic status, whether the player is human/AI.

# Version 111

* BUG: Late starting factions (aliens and Planet Cult) never got their extra colony. Now they do. Fixed incorrect calculation on game restart.

# Version 110

* Pressure Dome,                 8, 2.\
Same maintenance as for Recyclyng Tanks since it delivers same benefits.\
Should not be too dificult for sea bases to pay it.

# Version 109

* BUG: Late starting factions (aliens and Planet Cult) never got their extra colony. Now they do.

# Version 108

* Alternative inefficiency formula.\
https://github.com/tnevolin/thinker-doer#inefficiency

# Version 107

* Fungicide Tanks costs 0.\
I don't think they are so important to cost anything. The ability slot is big enough cost for it.
* Super Former costs 2.\
Again, not that superimportant ability.

# Version 106

* FIX: Zero division in Recycling Tanks mineral calculation when mineral intake is zero.

# Version 105

* BUG: Base screen population incorrectly shows superdrones those are not on psych screen. Fixed for alien factions as well.

# Version 104

* New basic units.
	* Gun Foil,               Foil,     Gun,          Scout,      3, 0, 0, DocFlex, -1, 00000000000000000000000000
	* Scout Rover,            Speeder,  Gun,          Scout,      3, 0, 0, Mobile,  -1, 00000000000000000000000000
	* Empath Rover,           Speeder,  Gun,          Scout,      3, 0, 0, CentEmp, -1, 00000000000000100000000000
* Empath Song costs 1 mineral row.

# Version 103

* Further modification to native life formulas.
	* Native life generation frequency is configurable.
	* Sea creatures generation frequency is configurable.
	* Native sudden death is configurable.

# Version 102

* Natives appears slightly less often. Previous version spawned too many of them.
* Police State,    DocLoy,   --EFFIC,     ++SUPPORT,   ++POLICE,     -PLANET\
With more abundant native life PLANET penalty for this choice is too harsh.

# Version 101

* Native life abundance modification.
	* Frequency of appearance is based on difficulty level rather than native life level.
	* Natives appears more often.
	* Natives do not suddenly die every 8th turn.

# Version 100

* Needlejet cost = 3.
* Gravship cost = 4.

# Version 99

* Pressure Dome increases minerals by 50% instead of improving base tile. Same effect as for Recycling Tank since it replaces it.

# Version 98

* Equally distant territory is given to base with smaller ID (presumably older one).

# Version 97

* FIX: Fixed bug in Knowledge SE.

# Version 96

* Cybernetic,      Algor,    ++EFFIC,  -----POLICE,    ++PLANET,    ++RESEARCH
It was too little benefits for such harsh POLICE penalty. Now it is more of less seems like future society.

# Version 95

* BUG: Base screen population incorrectly shows superdrones those are not on psych screen. They do not affect drone riot. This is fixed.

# Version 94

* AI tries to kill spore launcher near their bases.
* Artillery bonus per level of altitude is removed. Forgot to remove it earlier. I find it too cumbersome to measure altitudes of every tile around the battlefield. It is too not visual.

# Version 93

More distinct and bold SE modifications in a way to emphasise the lore of each SE.

* Democratic,      EthCalc,  ++EFFIC,     --SUPPORT,   ++GROWTH,     -INDUSTRY\
Returned original ++EFFIC and replaced PROBE penalty to INDUSTRY one. More distinct this way and probe was more of knowledge weakness.

* Planned,         InfNet,   --EFFIC,     ++GROWTH,     +INDUSTRY\
It was pretty fine original way. Didn't know why I changed it.

* Knowledge,       Cyber,     +EFFIC,      -GROWTH     --PROBE,   ++++RESEARCH\
Replaced EFFICIENCY penalty with GROWTH penalty. EFFICIENCY its negative values are quite uninteresting while GROWTH penalty offsets too much positive freebies in the game.
Also emphasised on research even more. This is, after all, an ultimate research focused SE choice.

* Wealth,          IndAuto,   +ECONOMY,   --MORALE,     -POLICE,    ++INDUSTRY\
This one gets one more well deserved INDUSTRY. This is an ultimate production focused SE choice. It was too weak originally.

* Eudaimonic,      Eudaim,   ++ECONOMY,    -EFFIC,    ---MORALE,    ++GROWTH\
Looses one of its EFFICIENCY penalty. I think it was too cripled for powerful future society. Should be decently effective now.

# Version 92

* Police State,    DocLoy,   --EFFIC,     ++SUPPORT,   ++POLICE,    --PLANET\
Returned --EFFIC and ++SUPPORT to it and also extra PLANET penalty. Should be a little bit more interesting like that.

* Democratic,      EthCalc,   +EFFIC,     --SUPPORT,   ++GROWTH,    --PROBE\
Reduced SUPPORT penalty. It seemed too harsh especially at the beginning.

* Fundamentalist,  Brain,    ++MORALE,    ++PROBE,      +INDUSTRY,  --RESEARCH\
Removed +TALENT, added +MORALE to make it more combat oriented and different from Police State drone quellying focus.

* Cybernetic,      Algor,     +EFFIC,  -----POLICE,    ++PLANET,    ++RESEARCH\
More benefits and more penalties. Before it was too not interesting.

* Thought Control, WillPow, ---SUPPORT,   ++MORALE,    ++POLICE,    ++PROBE,      ++TALENT\
Added extra TALENT to it. Should be an ultimate war time drone solution. It's pretty good at that but other than war it is not good for anything. So I don't think it become too OP.

# Version 91

* FIX: Removed "+" from SE choice giving talent and reverted to their exact original names. Apparently it messes things up sometimes.

# Version 90

* recycling_tanks_mineral_multiplier configuration parameter is added.

# Version 89

# Version 76

* The Universal Translator cost = 20. Reduced due to early availability and pathetic benfits.
