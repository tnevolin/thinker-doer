# Version 142

* Modified expansion parameters to build proportional number of colonies.

# Version 141

* Enhanced Thinker threat computation. Previously sealurks scared land colonies away.

# Version 140

* \[bug\] Didn't check map boundaries when iterated through adjacent tiles. That crashes game when base is placed on map border.

# Version 139

* All Brood Pit morale effects are disables same way as for Children Creche.

# Version 138

* AI:
  * Fine tuned colony production in small bases to see if they have enough population issue it at completion.
  * Fixed exploration calculations to account for combat units explorers only.
  * Former redundant order are cancelled so they do not create improvement that is already there.

# Version 137

* AI:
  * Set production exploration demand.
  * Adjusted produciton expansion demand based on range to destination and availabe settlement room.

# Version 136

* Merged with scient's 2.1 help.

# Version 135

* Weapon help always shows cost even if it equals to firepower.

# Version 134

* Rearranged facility priorities: submerge protection, defense, population limit, psych, growth, mineral, project, energy, fixed labs.
* Discouraged building colonies in base size 1.
* Biology Lab costs 4 and produces 4 labs. Without that it seems to be not desirable early choice. Extra labs bonus will diminish later on with higher technology cost anyway.

# Version 133

* AI tuning.
  * Psych facilities are considered if drones outnumbers talents or there are doctors.
  * Psych facilities list is extended to FAC_RECREATION_COMMONS, FAC_HOLOGRAM_THEATRE, FAC_PARADISE_GARDEN

* AI tuning.
  * Bases do not build units taking too much time. Configuration parameter: ai_production_unit_turns_limit.

# Version 131

* \[fix\] Captured base now properly receives free facilities from both capturing and captured factions. Didn't work in vanilla.

# Version 130

* AI base production and unit movement adjustment.
  * Base tries to build native protection if insufficient.
  * Unit in the base tries to hold to maintain native protection.
  * Base tries to build colonies if there is room for colonization.
* [bug] Battle status summary alignment messes up with Hasty and Gas modifiers. Feature removed.

# Version 129

* Experimental nutrient balance version #3.
  * Citizen nutrient intake = 2. Reverted to vanilla.
  * Farm nutrient bonus = 2 (both land and ocean).
  * Nutrient cost multiplier = 15.
  * Base Square produces 2 nutrients.

# Version 128

* Returned -1 Nutrient effect in mine square. This is in addition to nutrient balance. Otherwise some landmark mines produce too much nutrients.

# Version 127

* Further refinement to ZoC rule. Unit ignores ZoC only if target tile is occupied by own/pact unit that does not ignore ZoC by itself: probe, cloaked, air.

# Version 126

* Experimental nutrient balance version #2.
  * Citizen nutrient intake = 2. Reverted to vanilla.
  * Farm nutrient bonus = 2 (both land and ocean).
  * Nutrient cost multiplier = 15.
  * Base Square produces 1 nutrient.

# Version 125

# Version 123

* Experimental nutrient balance version.
  * 1,       ; Nutrient intake requirement for citizens
  * 15,      ; Nutrient cost multiplier
  * Base Square,      1, 1, 1, 0,

# Version 122

| Engineer | 5, 0, 1 |
| Librarian | 0, 0, 4 |
| Thinker | 0, 1, 5 |

# Version 119

* [bug] Tile yield calculation didn't set base. That caused crash for tile yield computation with collector on it and adjacent mirror when base is not set sometimes. Strangely it didn't bite me earlier.

# Version 118

* AAA bonus vs. air units = 50%.
* AAA Tracking ability cost = 1.

# Version 117

* Pressure Dome does not imply Recycling Tanks anymore. 
* [removed] Extra energy reserves to aquatic factions to support initial Pressure Dome maintenance.

# Version 116

* Extra energy reserves to aquatic factions to support initial Pressure Dome maintenance.

# Version 115

* [bug] Ignore independent units in reassignment code.

# Version 114

* Combat units are reassigned to avoid oversupport. Configuration parameter: unit_home_base_reassignment_production_threshold.

# Version 112

* AI build more defensive units based on: the combined strength of enemy attacking units, their distance from own bases, the diplomatic status, whether the player is human/AI.

# Version 111

* [fix] Late starting factions (aliens and Planet Cult) never got their extra colony. Now they do. Fixed incorrect calculation on game restart.

# Version 110

* Pressure Dome,                 8, 2.\
Same maintenance as for Recyclyng Tanks since it delivers same benefits.\
Should not be too dificult for sea bases to pay it.

# Version 109

* [fix] Late starting factions (aliens and Planet Cult) never got their extra colony. Now they do.

# Version 108

* Alternative inefficiency formula.\
https://github.com/tnevolin/thinker-doer#inefficiency

# Version 107

* Fungicide Tanks costs 0.\
I don't think they are so important to cost anything. The ability slot is big enough cost for it.
* Super Former costs 2.\
Again, not that superimportant ability.

# Version 106

* [fix] Zero division in Recycling Tanks mineral calculation when mineral intake is zero.

# Version 105

* [bug] Base screen population incorrectly shows superdrones those are not on psych screen. Fixed for alien factions as well.

# Version 104

* New basic units.
	* Gun Foil,               Foil,     Gun,          Scout,      3, 0, 0, DocFlex, -1, 00000000000000000000000000
	* Scout Rover,            Speeder,  Gun,          Scout,      3, 0, 0, Mobile,  -1, 00000000000000000000000000
	* Empath Rover,           Speeder,  Gun,          Scout,      3, 0, 0, CentEmp, -1, 00000000000000100000000000
* Empath Song costs 1 mineral row.

# Version 103

* Further modification to native life formulas.
	* Native life generation frequency is configurable.
	* Sea creatures generation frequency is configurable.
	* Native sudden death is configurable.

# Version 102

* Natives appears slightly less often. Previous version spawned too many of them.
* Police State,    DocLoy,   --EFFIC,     ++SUPPORT,   ++POLICE,     -PLANET\
With more abundant native life PLANET penalty for this choice is too harsh.

# Version 101

* Native life abundance modification.
	* Frequency of appearance is based on difficulty level rather than native life level.
	* Natives appears more often.
	* Natives do not suddenly die every 8th turn.

# Version 100

* Needlejet cost = 3.
* Gravship cost = 4.

# Version 99

* Pressure Dome increases minerals by 50% instead of improving base tile. Same effect as for Recycling Tank since it replaces it.

# Version 98

* Equally distant territory is given to base with smaller ID (presumably older one).

# Version 97

* [fix] Fixed bug in Knowledge SE.

# Version 96

* Cybernetic,      Algor,    ++EFFIC,  -----POLICE,    ++PLANET,    ++RESEARCH
It was too little benefits for such harsh POLICE penalty. Now it is more of less seems like future society.

# Version 95

* [bug] Base screen population incorrectly shows superdrones those are not on psych screen. They do not affect drone riot. This is fixed.

# Version 94

* AI tries to kill spore launcher near their bases.
* Artillery bonus per level of altitude is removed. Forgot to remove it earlier. I find it too cumbersome to measure altitudes of every tile around the battlefield. It is too not visual.

# Version 93

More distinct and bold SE modifications in a way to emphasise the lore of each SE.

* Democratic,      EthCalc,  ++EFFIC,     --SUPPORT,   ++GROWTH,     -INDUSTRY\
Returned original ++EFFIC and replaced PROBE penalty to INDUSTRY one. More distinct this way and probe was more of knowledge weakness.

* Planned,         InfNet,   --EFFIC,     ++GROWTH,     +INDUSTRY\
It was pretty fine original way. Didn't know why I changed it.

* Knowledge,       Cyber,     +EFFIC,      -GROWTH     --PROBE,   ++++RESEARCH\
Replaced EFFICIENCY penalty with GROWTH penalty. EFFICIENCY its negative values are quite uninteresting while GROWTH penalty offsets too much positive freebies in the game.
Also emphasised on research even more. This is, after all, an ultimate research focused SE choice.

* Wealth,          IndAuto,   +ECONOMY,   --MORALE,     -POLICE,    ++INDUSTRY\
This one gets one more well deserved INDUSTRY. This is an ultimate production focused SE choice. It was too weak originally.

* Eudaimonic,      Eudaim,   ++ECONOMY,    -EFFIC,    ---MORALE,    ++GROWTH\
Looses one of its EFFICIENCY penalty. I think it was too cripled for powerful future society. Should be decently effective now.

# Version 92

* Police State,    DocLoy,   --EFFIC,     ++SUPPORT,   ++POLICE,    --PLANET\
Returned --EFFIC and ++SUPPORT to it and also extra PLANET penalty. Should be a little bit more interesting like that.

* Democratic,      EthCalc,   +EFFIC,     --SUPPORT,   ++GROWTH,    --PROBE\
Reduced SUPPORT penalty. It seemed too harsh especially at the beginning.

* Fundamentalist,  Brain,    ++MORALE,    ++PROBE,      +INDUSTRY,  --RESEARCH\
Removed +TALENT, added +MORALE to make it more combat oriented and different from Police State drone quellying focus.

* Cybernetic,      Algor,     +EFFIC,  -----POLICE,    ++PLANET,    ++RESEARCH\
More benefits and more penalties. Before it was too not interesting.

* Thought Control, WillPow, ---SUPPORT,   ++MORALE,    ++POLICE,    ++PROBE,      ++TALENT\
Added extra TALENT to it. Should be an ultimate war time drone solution. It's pretty good at that but other than war it is not good for anything. So I don't think it become too OP.

# Version 91

* [fix] Removed "+" from SE choice giving talent and reverted to their exact original names. Apparently it messes things up sometimes.

# Version 90

* recycling_tanks_mineral_multiplier configuration parameter is added.

# Version 89

* Research is 1.25 times slower.

# Version 88

* Another adjustment to weapons/armors value/cost. Now they use more of less round and same numbers to ease up on player memory.

# Version 88

* Some more adjustment to weapons/armors value and cost.

# Version 87

* [fix] Unit cost were calculated incorrectly sometimes.

* Recycling Tanks now increases minerals by 50% instead of improving base tile.

* Needlejet chassis cost = 4.
* Gravship chassis cost = 6.
* Decifer ability cost to human readable text in Datalink.

# Version 76

* The Universal Translator cost = 20. Reduced due to early availability and pathetic benfits.
* The Planetary Datalinks cost = 80. It is too beneficial for 60.
* The Cyborg Factory cost = 160. It should be more expensive than CBA.
* The Clinical Immortality cost = 200. Cost increased due to doubling planetary votes. That is quite a big aid for diplomatic victory.
* The Space Elevator cost = 160. Average cost within era.
* The Cloning Vats = 120. Increased cost a little to match the era.
* The Ascent to Transcendence cost = 500. Increased slightly since now all empire bases are contributing to it.

# Version 24

* Reverted all factions back to one initial technology for everybody.
* Rearranged initial technologies to give Psych to -2 POLICE and Ecology to research impeded factions.
* Removed +1 mineral AQUATIC faction bonus.
* Removed Pirates -3 SUPPORT penalty that was there earlier to neutralize their mineral bonus.
* Gave Pirates +1 POLICE. Now they start with 0 POLICE to help their accelerated growth in mineral deficit.
* Removed all hurry thresholds.
* Collateral damage computation is fixed to take exact percentage of the unit HPs. Vanilla computation for conventional combat multiply this by ATTACKER reactor power instead.
* Modified collateral damage to take 20% instead 30% in vanilla.

# Version 23

* Moved reactor cost factors configuration to thinker.ini.
* Added alternative_base_defensive_structure_bonuses switch to thinker.ini.
* Adjusted reactor appearence in technology tree to be closer to 25%, 50%, 75% marks.
* Set Fanatic attack bonus = 25.
* Set Mobile unit in open ground = 25.
* Set Infantry vs. Base = 25.
* Set Forest Square,    1, 2, 0, 0,

# Version 22

* Exposed Perimeter Defense and Tachyon Field bonuses in thinker.ini.
* Set Alternative unit hurry cost formula.
* Set Alternative upgrade cost formula.
* Weapon icon selection algorithm fix.

# Version 21

* Conventional combat now ignores reactor power same way as psi combat does.
* Odds calculation now ignore reactor power for both conventional and psi combat. For psi combat it was actually a bug that nobody ever fixed yet.
* Each higher reactors now decrease unit cost approximately by 20% comparing to predecessor. Chaged weapon and armor cost so it increases at about 50-60% rate of the item value. This way unit cost still growth but slower than strength.
* Returned all prototype cost back to vanilla values.
* Returned back to original cost/maintenance: Skunkworks.
* Added TECH, Mobile to MORGAN.
* Added TECH, PrPsych to UNIV.
* Added TECH, Physic to SPARTANS.
* Added TECH, Psych to GAIANS.
* Added TECH, Ecology to BELIEVE.
* Added TECH, DocFlex to HIVE.
* Added TECH, Indust to PEACE.
* Added TECH, Ecology to CYBORG.
* Added TECH, PrPsych to DRONE.
* Added TECH, Physic to PIRATES.
* Added TECH, DocFlex to FUNGBOY.
* Added TECH, Psych to ANGELS.
* Added TECH, Indust to CARETAKE.
* Added TECH, Mobile to USURPER.

# Version 20

Initial release. See list of changes in readme.

# TODO

* Make condenser and enricher fixes configurable.
* HSA should stop the probe movement as well.
* Sea units are returned to land bases. When pact is cancelled, when sea probe is returned unharmed.
* Transport doesn't carry colony.
* Research gene warfare and its unit damaging effect. See if we need to tone this down a bit.
* Move plant fungus later.
* Revert forest yield, delay HF and make it more expensive.
* Brood Pit give just +1 POLICE.
* Make AI build more units, defensive structures, sensors.
* Rework probe team success rates.
* Cloning Vats should not grant impunities.
* Copy basic units to player unit pool.
* Don't display basic units in design workshop.
* Prototype only new component, not the whole unit.

## AI

* Expand more.
* Control transports better.
* Do not build expensive units taking long to produce.
* Colony search for base should be more straightforward.
