# Description

This is an executable mod built on top of Thinker mod. Thinker mod is bundled in. No need to install it separately.

This mod was tested on GOG SMAX version.

# Disclaimer

This is fan made mod that goes without warranty of any kind! Use it on your own risk. I recommend to install it to dedicated game directory and do not mix it with other mods.

# Installation

Take latest release package from here (TheWillToPower-###.zip) and unpack it to temporary directory.

## Core files

Copy files from **core** folder to game directory overwriting existing files.

## Factions

Optional but recommended faction modifications. These are minimal changes required to match core rule changes.

Copy files from **factions** folder to game directory overriding existing files.

## Multiplayer

Copy files from **multiplayer** folder to game directory overriding existing files. These are multiplayer version of game configuration.

# Run

Run terranx_mod.exe or thinker.exe. They should do the same thing except maybe different resolution.

# Preserving user configuration

Program scans "thinker_user.ini" and load configuration from there overriding default one. This file is NOT in the installation specifically because it SHOULD NOT be overwriten by it.
You need to create your own and copy desired values from default configuration those you want to modify and preserve across releases.
