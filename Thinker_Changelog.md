# Thinker mod release changelog

## Version 4.3 (2024-05-26)
* Random map generator allows placing multiple similar landmarks when the related option value is greater than one.
* Modify Mind Control probe action to only subvert units inside the base and not on adjacent tiles to balance for the relatively cheap cost for this action.
* Modify Total Thought Control probe action so that the AI will not always sneak attack. This action can be still used to subvert bases without declaring war but it applies a notable diplomatic penalty between the factions.
* Many changes on AI diplomacy code related to tech trading, energy loans, base swaps and threats to cancel the current alliance.
* Add options modify_upgrade_cost, normal_elite_moves and native_elite_moves.
* Add possibility to scroll the prototype list in design workshop with the mouse wheel.
* Change energy market crash event icon to genwarning_sm.pcx while previously it was markbm_sm.pcx.
* Fix reactivating skipped units not working for aircraft units that have not moved.
* Fix magtube_movement_rate issue with aircraft units when the cost is non-zero.
* Fix chopper movement points being modified when the combat is canceled from the confirmation dialog.
* Fix some game preferences being reset when starting a new game with ignore_reactor_power enabled.
* Fix Mind Control issue when capturing bases that have non-allied units owned by a third faction inside them.
* Fix datalinks window not showing the first character for Sea Formers units.
* Fix issue with event_market_crash option that occurred during turn processing.

* Base window support tab shows a terrain view that is zoomable with the mousewheel or Ctrl+Up/Down.
* Players on two lowest difficulty levels will start accumulating labs immediately instead of 5 turns later (early_research_start).
* Add event_market_crash option to select if the event is enabled. This can now reduce energy reserves by 1/2 when the faction has more than 1000 credits.
* Add biology_lab_bonus option to adjust the research bonus granted by the facility. AI may sometimes build this facility if the benefit is large enough.
* AI will also consider suitable non-combat predefined units for production even if the tech for corresponding non-combat module is not available.
* Planetpearls option is set by default to slightly reduce planetpearls income.
* Patch Stockpile Energy when it enabled double production if the base produces one item and then switches to Stockpile Energy on the same turn gaining additional credits.
* Stockpile Energy also shows extra credits gained per turn on the base resource view.
* Minor changes on AI priorities with naval pathfinding and objective bases in scenario mode.
* Fix base governor not building prototype units in some cases if the prototype cost is zero.
* Fix startup issues with the game launcher when the keyboard shortcuts were not working.

* Fix production picker showing incorrect Stockpile Energy output in the selection list when Planetary Energy Grid is built.
* Fix world map shifting the bottom row of tiles to the wrong side of screen when the map is zoomed out.
* Fix rare issue where the game freezes during turn processing if some of the combat units are automated.

* Map mirroring config options are renamed in thinker.ini.
* Fix minor issues with mouse wheel zooming on the world map.

* When a base is captured that was previously owned by active third faction and the time to assimilate the base was more than 10 turns, the previous owner is preserved after capture.

## Version 2.9 (2021-12-17)
* Thinker now uses a new launcher program called thinker.exe to start the mod. It requires having the original terranx.exe version in the game folder.
* Base hurry dialog is overhauled to display the minimal required hurry cost to complete the current production on the next turn.
* Minimal hurry cost is now the default choice when a partial cost is entered instead of the full cost like previously.

## Version 2.3 (2020-12-27)
* New option: cpu_idle_fix lowers the processing power consumption to a minimum by throttling unnecessary code. This uses the same method than smac-cpu-fix patch.
* New option: rare_supply_pods will reduce the frequency of supply pods to around one third of previous levels and instead places bonus resources on random maps. This option is a lesser version of "no unity scattering".
* New option: smooth_scrolling (disabled by default) adds support for some user interface enhancements provided by PlotinusRedux's PRACX mod.
* New option: windowed adds support to run the game using a user-supplied resolution. Command line option -windowed is also supported.

* Changed territory_border_fix to increase the expansion of coastal base territory into ocean to an equal amount of actual sea bases.
* New feature: ALT+T shortcut displays general statistics about the factions.
* New feature: the game engine has a crash handler provided by Thinker that writes output to debug.txt if the game happens to crash for any reason.
* Set config option ignore_reactor_power enabled by default. This is non-vanilla but a much needed balance fix.
* AI tries to leave slightly more space between bases and prioritize locating bases on the ocean coastline.
* AI should build Tree Farms faster if the bases encounter eco damage unless the faction file has a negative PLANET modifier.
* AI will now attempt to raise land bridges between continents more often using better pathing. These goals are also stored in the save game.
* AI will occasionally disband formers or colony pods if there's no use for them.


## Version 2.2 (2020-11-15)
* New option: clean_minerals sets the amount of minerals a base can produce before experiencing eco damage.

* Fix very rare issue where a faction might get eliminated even when they had active colony pods.


## Version 2.1 (2020-11-08)
* New option: ignore_reactor_power (disabled by default). This makes the combat calculation ignore reactor power and treat every unit as having a fission reactor. Combat odds are also properly displayed in the confirmation dialog. More advanced reactors still provide their usual cost discounts. Planet busters are unaffected by this feature.
* New option: territory_border_fix will make the oldest bases claim tiles that are equidistant between two bases of different factions. Coastal bases also expand territory into the ocean for each of the 20 workable tiles in the base radius.
* Addition to eco_damage_fix: clean minerals cap will now increase every time Tree Farm, Hybrid Forest, Centauri Preserve or Temple of Planet is built even if no fungal pop has been encountered yet. It is not necessary anymore to delay building these facilities to alleviate eco damage.
* Faction placement is improved on custom maps where some starting locations were not previously picked.
* AI production planner tries to avoid building certain secret projects if they yield only marginal benefits.
* Include also TALENT and ROBUST modifiers in social_ai calculation.
* Fix issue where alien factions didn't gain the bonuses provided by free_colony_pods or free_formers.
* Fix issue where governors didn't sometimes work in player-owned bases.

* AI sometimes builds Tachyon Fields, Geosynchronous Survey Pods and Flechette Defense Systems.

* Add meaningful error message dialogs if some of the startup checks for Thinker fail.
* Import the following patches from Will To Power mod by tnevolin: collateral_damage_value, disable_planetpearls, disable_aquatic_bonus_minerals. Each of them also has their own config option.
* New option: auto_relocate_hq will automatically move lost HQs to another suitable base.

* Fix issue where AI bases sometimes persist without any defenders. AI will now force switch production away from facilities if no valid defenders are present.
* Fix a bug where attacking other satellites didn't work in Orbital Attack View when smac_only was activated. Credits: Scient.
* Fix engine bug where a faction with enough energy credits would attempt to Corner Energy Market every turn. Now the AI properly only attempts it once and waits for the countdown to complete.
