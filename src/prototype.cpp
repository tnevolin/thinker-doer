/**
Prototype cost calculation.

Select primary and secondary weapon/module/armor items
primary item = one with higher true cost
secondary item = one with lower true cost

Calculate unit base cost
unit base cost = primary item cost + secondary item cost / 2 - 1

Multiply by reactor cost factor
reactor cost factor = reactor cost / Fission reactor cost

Multiply by chassis cost factor
chassis cost factor = chassis cost / 2

Multiply by ability factor or add ability flat cost
ability bytes 0-3 is unit cost factor
ability bytes 4-7 is unit cost flat addition

All fractional factors are turned into whole rational fractions.
For example, ability with cost 1 multiplies unit cost by 1.25. This is coded in formula as multiplication by 5/4.

All divisions are done after multiplications. This is to minimize an effect of integer rounding on intermediary steps.

Special rules:
Supply module foil/cruiser chassis cost is replaced with infantry/speeder chassis cost, correspondingly.
