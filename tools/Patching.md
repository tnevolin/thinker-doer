Patches included in the release version
=======================================

Thinker's release version is currently based on the GOG version of the game binary (3 084 288 bytes, GOG version SHA-1: 4b19c1fe3266b5ebc4305cd182ed6e864e3a1c4a). This file already contains official patches but Thinker also includes Scient's patch v2.0 in the release.

This repo contains the binary diff between GOG binary and Thinker's release. It is possible to regenerate the diff file `terranx.dif` using the tools provided here:

    ./binarydiff.py terranx.exe terranx_mod.exe

In the diff listing, the vast majority of changes relate to Scient's patch with the exception of these address ranges (38 lines total) that add thinker.dll to the dll import table. They will replace an existing unused entry that was left in the binary for unknown reason.

    00280A1E .. 00280A32
    002EF4FC .. 002EF516

After acquiring the diff listing, it possible to use `idapatch.py` to convert it into PatchByte script commands that can used by IDA. When the unmodified GOG binary is loaded in IDA, entering all the PatchByte commands will transform it into `terranx_mod.exe`.

At game startup, Windows will attempt to load thinker.dll from the same folder before the game starts. Note that Windows will terminate the process if any of the dll dependencies from the import table are not available. When thinker.dll is loading, it will attempt to patch the game binary image residing in the same address space before the actual game can start. 
This way it is not required to write any of the actual patches to the exe file, instead they can be applied dynamically at runtime. Thinker also performs some sanity checks during patching, and it is designed to terminate the game process with an error message if any of the checks fail.


Patching OpenSMACX to work with Thinker
=======================================

Due to the simplicity of Thinker's loading method, [OpenSMACX](https://github.com/b-casey/OpenSMACX/) can be patched manually in a hex editor to also load Thinker at startup.

Note that this combination of patches is not fully tested and some glitches may appear in the game that are not present in the standard game binary. After patching, OpenSMACX binary will not start unless thinker.dll can also be loaded from the same folder by Windows.

1. Open `terranx_opensmacx_v0.2.1.exe` (or latest release) in a hex editor
2. Replace any string `SHELL32.dll` with `thinker.dll`
3. Replace any string `ShellExecuteA` with `ThinkerDecide`
4. Move all exe and dll files to the same folder with Alpha Centauri

Thinker should now start along with OpenSMACX. Thinker version should always be visible in the game version menu (Ctrl+F4). If this is not the case, Thinker did not start correctly with the game. Check if you are actually running the game binary with the imports patched as described above.
